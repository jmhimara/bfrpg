    "text": "It was our third foray into the dungeons beneath the ancient fortress in the middle of the river. We were on the second level down from the ruins, standing before the great bronze doors beyond which we believed lay the tomb of an ancient barbarian chieftain. I hadn’t believed the tales of the old drunk at the tavern back at Morgansfort, but for some reason Apoqulis, the Cleric, believed him. Turned out his stories were true… mostly, anyway.\nI held a torch for Barthal, the Thief, as he tried briefly to pick the lock. He turned around and said, “It must be held by magic. The lock won’t even wiggle.”\nMorningstar, the Elf, smiled. “I have just the thing,” she said, drawing from her backpack the scroll we took from the goblins. She unrolled it and began to read, and though I couldn’t understand her words I could see the characters burning away as she read them, little wisps of smoke as from a candle rising up from each in turn. Seeing that she was nearly through, I turned my attention to the lock. I’m not sure what I was expecting, but the little puff of dust that came from it as she finished didn’t seem like much. She turned to Barthal and said, “Try again.”\nI’m tempted to say that Barthal bent to his work, but he’s a Halfling; at just over three feet tall he could look straight into the lock without stooping a bit. I must have looked impatient, as Apoqulis leaned over to me and said, “Be still, Darion, he’ll be through in a moment or two.”\nThen I heard a loud click, and Barthal turned to me with a smile. “It’s open, my friend. After you!” I handed him the torch, then stepped to the doors, sword drawn, and Morningstar joined me, likewise ready. I steeled myself and opened the doors…\nBeyond lay a stone sarcophagus, resting atop a raised platform. Strewn about the floor were many human skeletons. Apoqulis made a sign with his hand that I didn’t recognize; then we walked in carefully, trying not to trip over the bones. I noticed among the bones several bronze swords, covered in verdigris. I stepped to the sarcophagus. “The lid is likely very heavy,” I said. “Come, Morningstar, rather than lift it, let’s turn it about so we can see what treasures lie inside.”\nMorningstar called “Wait!” but it was too late… I had already laid hands upon the sarcophagus. The bones on the floor began to rattle, then rose up and assembled themselves in a mockery of life. Without delay they picked up their swords from the floor and began to attack us. I would have to wait until later to kick myself, I mused, as I put my back against the sarcophagus and began to fight the monsters…\n\nWhat is this ?\nThe Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game is a rules-light game system written with inspiration from early roleplaying game systems.  It is intended for those who are fans of “old-school” game mechanics.  Basic Fantasy RPG is simple enough for children in perhaps second or third grade to play, yet still has enough depth for adults as well.\n\n\nWhat is a Role-Playing Game?\nIn the almost 50 years since the first role-playing game appeared, much has changed. Most people have at least heard the names of one or two such games, and many, many people have played. Still, there are those who have not tried RPGs; if you are one of those people, this part is for you.\nRole-playing games are played by a number of players, commonly two to eight, and a Game Master, or GM (often called something else, but the job remains the same regardless of the title). Each player generally plays one character, called a player character or PC, while the Game Master is responsible for running the world, creating and managing the towns, nations, ruins, non-player characters (or NPCs), monsters, treasure, and all other things that aid or challenge the players. Dice are often used to determine the success or failure of most actions that take place in the game; Basic Fantasy RPG uses polyhedral dice, described below, for this purpose.\nIn effect, role-playing games are just grown-up games of pretend. If you remember playing pretend as a child, you may recall having some difficulty deciding whose idea should have precedence… if one child plays a knight and the other a dragon, who will win? Surely the knight doesn’t win every time. Role-playing games have rules to determine such things. These rules can range from the very free-form and simple to the very complex and detailed.\nThis game attempts to walk the line between simple and complex, free-form and detailed. Too much detail and complexity slows the game down as players and GM spend much time leafing through the rules and little time actually playing. Free-form games with simple resolution systems demand more mental agility from the participants, and are much more dependent on the good judgment of the Game Master to maintain balance. Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game falls between these two extremes, having rules for the most common activities and guidelines to help the Game Master judge the unexpected.\n\n\nWhat Do I Need to Play?\nIf you are to be a player, you should have a pencil, some notebook paper, and a set of dice. Someone in your player group probably needs to have some graph paper (4 or 5 squares per inch is best) for drawing maps. You can use preprinted character sheets (such as those available on the Basic Fantasy RPG website) if you wish, but notebook paper works fine.\nIf you are the Game Master, you need all of the above. If this is your first time as GM, or you have limited preparation time, you might wish to use a pre-written adventure (called a module) rather than create one yourself. Several modules are distributed for free on the basicfantasy.org website; many of the modules available on the website are specifically designed for use with a party of new players. Adventure modules written for other game systems may also be used, but the Game Master may need to spend some time “converting” such a module before beginning play.\n\n\n\nUsing the Dice\nThe 20 sided die, or d20, is one of the most important dice in the game: it is used to resolve attack rolls and saving throws (concepts that will be explained later). In general, the die is rolled, modifiers added or subtracted, and if the total result equals or exceeds a target number, the roll is a success; otherwise it has failed.\nThe 10 sided die, or d10, is used to generate numbers from 1 to 10; it is numbered 0 to 9, but a roll of 0 is normally counted as 10. A pair of d10’s are also used together to generate numbers from 1 to 100, where a roll of 00 is counted as 100. The two dice should be different colors, and the player must declare which is the tens die and which is the ones die before rolling them! (Or, the player may have a die marked with double digits, as shown.) Rolling two d10’s in this way is called a percentile roll, or d%. These rolls are generally against target numbers, but for the roll to be a success, the result must be equal to or less than the target number. So for example, a character using a Thief ability (described later) with a 30% chance of success rolls the dice: if the result is 01 to 30, the roll is a success.\nThe 4 sided die, or d4, is a special case. It is not so much rolled as “flipped,” and the number which is upright is the result of the roll. Note that d4’s are made in two different styles, as shown; regardless of which style you have, the number rolled is the one which is upright on all visible sides.\nThe other dice normally used have 6, 8, and 12 sides, and are called d6, d8, and d12. d6’s may be made with either numbers or pips; it makes no difference which type you choose.\nWhen multiple dice are to be rolled and added together, it’s noted in the text like this: 2d6 (roll two d6 dice and add them together), or 3d4 (roll three d4 dice and add them together). A modifier may be noted as a “plus” value, such as 2d8+2 (roll two d8 dice and add them together, then add 2 to the total)."

    "text": "How to Create a Player Character\nFirst, you will need a piece of paper to write down the character’s statistics on. You may use a preprinted character sheet if one is available, or you may simply use a piece of notebook paper. An example character is shown below. You should use a pencil to write down all information, as any statistic may change during play.\nRoll 3d6 for each ability score, as described in the Character Abilities section, and write the results after the names of the abilities. Write down the scores in the order you roll them; if you are unhappy with the scores you have rolled, ask your Game Master for advice, as he or she may allow some form of point or score exchanging.\nWrite down the ability score bonus (or penalty) for each score beside the score itself, as shown on the table on the next page.\nChoose a race and class for your character. Your character must meet the Prime Requisite minimum for a class, as described in the Character Classes section, in order to be a member of that class. Also note that there are minimum (and maximum) ability requirements for the various races which must be met, as described in the Character Races section.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Character Information\n\n\nWrite down the special abilities of your race and class choices, as described below. If you have chosen to play a Magic-User, ask your Game Master what spell or spells your character knows; it’s up to the Game Master to decide this, but he or she may allow you to choose one or more spells yourself.\nNote on your character sheet that your character has zero (0) experience points (or XP); also you may want to note the number needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for your class.\nRoll the hit die appropriate for your class, adding your Constitution bonus or penalty, and note the result as your hit points on your character sheet. Note that, should your character have a Constitution penalty, the penalty will not lower any hit die roll below 1 (so if your Character has a -2 penalty for Constitution, and you roll a 2, the total is adjusted to 1).\nRoll for your starting money. Generally your character will start with 3d6 times 10 gold pieces, but ask the Game Master before rolling.\nNow, purchase equipment for your character, as shown in the Equipment section. Write your purchases on your character sheet, and note how much money remains afterward. Make sure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for your class and race before making your purchases.\nSince you now know what sort of armor your character is wearing, you should note your Armor Class on your character sheet. Don’t forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to the figure.\nLook up your character’s attack bonus (see Table 14.2 in Encounters) and note it on your character sheet. Don’t add your ability bonuses (or penalties) to this figure, as you will add a different bonus (Strength or Dexterity) depending on the sort of weapon you use in combat (i.e. melee or missile weapon).\nAlso look up your saving throws (from the tables near the end of the Encounter or at the appropriate class ) and note them on your character sheet. Adjust the saving throw figures based on your race, if your character is a demi-human (see Character Races). Please note that the saving throw bonuses for demi-humans are presented as “plus” values, to be added to the die roll; for convenience, you may simply subtract them from the saving throw numbers on the character sheet instead.\nFinally, if you haven’t done so already, name your character. This often takes longer than all the other steps combined."

    "section": "Ability Scores",
    "text": "Ability Scores\nEach character will have a score ranging from 3 to 18 in each of the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with each score, as shown on the table below. Each class has a Prime Requisite ability score, which must be at least 9 in order for the character to become a member of that class; also, there are required minimum and maximum scores for each character race other than Humans, as described under Character Races.\n\n\n\nAbility Score\nBonus/Penalty\n\n\n\n\n3\n-3\n\n\n4-5\n-2\n\n\n6-8\n-1\n\n\n9-12\n0\n\n\n13-15\n+1\n\n\n16-17\n+2\n\n\n18\n+3\n\n\n\nStrength: As the name implies, this ability measures the character’s raw physical power. Strength is the Prime Requisite for Fighters. Apply the ability bonus or penalty for Strength to all attack and damage rolls in melee (hand to hand) combat. Note that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful attack below one point in any case (see the Combat section for details).\nIntelligence: This is the ability to learn and apply knowledge. Intelligence is the Prime Requisite for Magic-Users. The ability bonus for Intelligence is added to the number of languages the character is able to learn to read and write; if the character has an Intelligence penalty, he or she cannot read more than a word or two, and will only know his or her native language.\nWisdom: A combination of intuition, willpower and common sense. Wisdom is the Prime Requisite for Clerics. The Wisdom bonus or penalty may apply to some saving throws vs. magical attacks, particularly those affecting the target’s will.\nDexterity: This ability measures the character’s quickness and balance as well as aptitude with tools. Dexterity is the Prime Requisite for Thieves. The Dexterity bonus or penalty is applied to all attack rolls with missile (ranged) weapons, to the character’s Armor Class value, and to the character’s Initiative die roll.\nConstitution: A combination of general health and vitality. Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each hit die rolled by the character. Note that a penalty here will not reduce any hit die roll to less than 1 point.\nCharisma: This is the ability to influence or even lead people; those with high Charisma are well-liked, or at least highly respected. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to reaction rolls. Also, the number of retainers a character may hire, and the loyalty of those retainers, is affected by Charisma.\n\nStat Roller\n\nimport { generalDice } from \"./custom.js\"\n\nviewof statRolls = Inputs.button(\"Roll Stats\", {value: null, reduce: () =&gt; [generalDice(3,6,0),generalDice(3,6,0),generalDice(3,6,0),generalDice(3,6,0),generalDice(3,6,0),generalDice(3,6,0)]})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport { calculateModifier } from \"./custom.js\"\n{\n    var x = \"\"\n/*     if (statRolls != null){\n        x = md`&lt;br&gt;${statRolls[0]} &emsp; (${calculateModifier(statRolls[0])}) \n        &lt;br&gt;${statRolls[1]} &emsp; (${calculateModifier(statRolls[1])})\n        &lt;br&gt;${statRolls[2]} &emsp; (${calculateModifier(statRolls[2])})\n        &lt;br&gt;${statRolls[3]} &emsp; (${calculateModifier(statRolls[3])}) \n        &lt;br&gt;${statRolls[4]} &emsp; (${calculateModifier(statRolls[4])}) \n        &lt;br&gt;${statRolls[5]} &emsp; (${calculateModifier(statRolls[5])})`\n    } else {x = md`&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Press button to roll stats&lt;b&gt;`} */\n\n    if (statRolls != null) {\n        x = html`&lt;br&gt;&lt;table style=\"max-width:20%;\"&gt;\n                    &lt;tr&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;${statRolls[0]}&lt;/td&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;(${calculateModifier(statRolls[0])})&lt;/td&gt;\n                    &lt;/tr&gt;\n                    &lt;tr&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;${statRolls[1]}&lt;/td&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;(${calculateModifier(statRolls[1])})&lt;/td&gt;\n                    &lt;/tr&gt;\n                    &lt;tr&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;${statRolls[2]}&lt;/td&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;(${calculateModifier(statRolls[2])})&lt;/td&gt;\n                    &lt;/tr&gt;\n                    &lt;tr&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;${statRolls[3]}&lt;/td&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;(${calculateModifier(statRolls[3])})&lt;/td&gt;\n                    &lt;/tr&gt;\n                    &lt;tr&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;${statRolls[4]}&lt;/td&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;(${calculateModifier(statRolls[4])})&lt;/td&gt;\n                    &lt;/tr&gt;\n                    &lt;tr&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;${statRolls[5]}&lt;/td&gt;\n                        &lt;td&gt;(${calculateModifier(statRolls[5])})&lt;/td&gt;\n                    &lt;/tr&gt;\n                `\n    } else {x = md`&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Press button to roll stats&lt;b&gt;`}\n\n    return x\n    }"

Dwarves have stout frames and a strong, muscular build. They are rugged and resilient, with the capacity to endure great hardships. Dwarves are typically practical, stubborn and courageous. They can also be introspective, suspicious and possessive. They have a lifespan of three to four centuries.\nRestrictions: Dwarves may become Clerics, Fighters, or Thieves. They are required to have a minimum Constitution of 9. Due to their generally dour dispositions, they may not have a Charisma higher than 17. They may not employ Large weapons more than four feet in length (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and longbows).\nSpecial Abilities: All Dwarves have Darkvision with a 60’ range, and are able to detect slanting passages, traps, shifting walls and new construction on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6; a search must be performed before this roll may be made.\nSaving Throws: Dwarves gain a +4 vs. Death Ray or Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and a +3 vs. Dragon Breath."

Most Clerics spend their time in mundane forms of service such as preaching and ministering in a temple; but there are those who are called to go abroad from the temple and serve their deity in a more direct way, smiting undead monsters and aiding in the battle against evil and chaos. Player character Clerics are assumed to be among the latter group.\nClerics fight about as well as Thieves, but not as well as Fighters. They are hardier than Thieves, at least at lower levels, as they are accustomed to physical labor that the Thief would deftly avoid. Clerics can cast spells of divine nature starting at 2nd level, and they have the power to Turn the Undead, that is, to drive away undead monsters by means of faith alone (see the Encounter section for details).\nThe Prime Requisite for Clerics is Wisdom; a character must have a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Cleric. They may wear any armor, but may only use blunt weapons (specifically including warhammer, mace, maul, club, quarterstaff, and sling).\n\n\nTable 5.1: Cleric Saving Throws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDeath Ray / Poison\nMagic Wands\nParalysis / Petrify\nDragon Breath\nSpells\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n11\n12\n14\n16\n15\n\n\n\n2-3\n10\n11\n13\n15\n14\n\n\n\n4-5\n9\n10\n13\n15\n14\n\n\n\n6-7\n9\n10\n12\n14\n13\n\n\n\n8-9\n8\n9\n12\n14\n13\n\n\n\n10-11\n8\n9\n11\n13\n12\n\n\n\n12-13\n7\n8\n11\n13\n12\n\n\n\n14-15\n7\n8\n10\n12\n11\n\n\n\n16-17\n6\n7\n10\n12\n11\n\n\n\n18-19\n6\n7\n9\n11\n10\n\n\n\n20\n5\n6\n9\n11\n10"

They train in combat, and they generally approach problems head on, weapon drawn.\nNot surprisingly, Fighters are best at fighting of all the classes. They are also the hardiest, able to take more punishment than any other class. Although they are not skilled in the ways of magic, Fighters can nonetheless use many magic items, including but not limited to magical weapons and armor.\nThe Prime Requisite for Fighters is Strength; a character must have a Strength score of 9 or higher to become a Fighter.

They do magic not as the Cleric does, by faith in a greater power, but rather through insight and understanding.\nMagic-Users are the worst of all the classes at fighting; hours spent studying massive tomes of magic do not lead a character to become strong or adept with weapons. They are the least hardy, equal to Thieves at lower levels but quickly falling behind.\nThe Prime Requisite for Magic-Users is Intelligence; a character must have an Intelligence score of 9 or higher to become a Magic-User. The only weapons they become proficient with are the dagger and the walking staff (or cudgel). Magic-Users may not wear armor of any sort nor use a shield as such things interfere with spellcasting.\nA first level Magic-User begins play knowing read magic and one other spell of first level. These spells are written in a spellbook provided by his or her master. The GM may roll for the spell, assign it as he or she sees fit, or allow the player to choose it, at his or her option.

Avoidance of honest work leads Thieves to be less hardy than the other classes, though they do pull ahead of the Magic-Users at higher levels.\nThe Prime Requisite for Thieves is Dexterity; a character must have a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to become a Thief. They may use any weapon, but may not wear metal armor as it interferes with stealthy activities, nor may they use shields of any sort. Leather armor is acceptable, however.\nThieves have a number of special abilities, described below. One Turn must generally be spent to use any of these abilities, though the GM may amend this as he or she sees fit. The GM may choose to make any of these rolls on behalf of the player, at his or her option, to help maintain the proper state of uncertainty. Also note that the GM may apply situational adjustments (plus or minus percentage points) as he or she sees fit; for instance, it’s obviously harder to climb a wall slick with slime than one that is dry, so the GM might apply a penalty of 20% for the slimy wall.\n\n\nTable 5.4: Thief Saving Throws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDeath Ray / Poison\nMagic Wands\nParalysis / Petrify\nDragon Breath\nSpells\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n13\n14\n13\n16\n15\n\n\n\n2-3\n12\n14\n12\n15\n14\n\n\n\n4-5\n11\n13\n12\n14\n13\n\n\n\n6-7\n11\n13\n11\n13\n13\n\n\n\n8-9\n10\n12\n11\n12\n12\n\n\n\n10-11\n9\n12\n10\n11\n11\n\n\n\n12-13\n9\n10\n10\n10\n11\n\n\n\n14-15\n8\n10\n9\n9\n10\n\n\n\n16-17\n7\n9\n9\n8\n9\n\n\n\n18-19\n7\n9\n8\n7\n9\n\n\n\n20\n6\n8\n8\n6\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThief Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThief Level\nOpen Locks\nRemove Traps\nPick Pockets\nMove Silently\nClimb Walls\nHide\nListen\n\n\n\n\n1\n25\n20\n30\n25\n80\n10\n30\n\n\n2\n30\n25\n35\n30\n81\n15\n34\n\n\n3\n35\n30\n40\n35\n82\n20\n38\n\n\n4\n40\n35\n45\n40\n83\n25\n42\n\n\n5\n45\n40\n50\n45\n84\n30\n46\n\n\n6\n50\n45\n55\n50\n85\n35\n50\n\n\n7\n55\n50\n60\n55\n86\n40\n54\n\n\n8\n60\n55\n65\n60\n87\n45\n58\n\n\n9\n65\n60\n70\n65\n88\n50\n62\n\n\n10\n68\n63\n74\n68\n89\n53\n65\n\n\n11\n71\n66\n78\n71\n90\n56\n68\n\n\n12\n74\n69\n82\n74\n91\n59\n71\n\n\n13\n77\n72\n86\n77\n92\n62\n74\n\n\n14\n80\n75\n90\n80\n93\n65\n77\n\n\n15\n83\n78\n94\n83\n94\n68\n80\n\n\n16\n84\n79\n95\n85\n95\n69\n83\n\n\n17\n85\n80\n96\n87\n96\n70\n86\n\n\n18\n86\n81\n97\n89\n97\n71\n89\n\n\n19\n87\n82\n98\n91\n98\n72\n92\n\n\n20\n88\n83\n99\n93\n99\n73\n95\n\n\n\nOpen Locks allows the Thief to unlock a lock without a proper key. It may only be tried once per lock. If the attempt fails, the Thief must wait until he or she has gained another level of experience before trying again.\nRemove Traps is generally rolled twice: first to detect the trap, and second to disarm it. The GM will make these rolls as the player won’t know for sure if the character is successful or not until someone actually tests the trapped (or suspected) area.\nPick Pockets allows the Thief to lift the wallet, cut the purse, etc. of a victim without the victim noticing. Obviously, if the roll is failed, the Thief didn’t get what he or she wanted; but further, the intended victim (or an onlooker, at the GM’s option) will notice the attempt if the die roll is more than two times the target number (or if the die roll is 00).\nMove Silently, like Remove Traps, is always rolled by the GM. The Thief will usually believe he or she is moving silently regardless of the die roll, but those he or she is trying to avoid will hear the Thief if the roll is failed.\nClimb Walls permits the Thief to climb sheer surfaces with few or no visible handholds. This ability should normally be rolled by the player. If the roll fails, the Thief falls from about halfway up the wall or other vertical surface. The GM may require multiple rolls if the distance climbed is more than 100 feet. See Falling Damage.\nHide permits the Thief to hide in any shadowed area large enough to contain his or her body. Like Move Silently, the Thief always believes he or she is being successful, so the GM makes the roll. A Thief hiding in shadows must remain still for this ability to work.\nListen is generally used to listen at a door, or to try to listen for distant sounds in a dungeon. The GM must decide what noises the Thief might hear; a successful roll means only that a noise could have been heard. The GM should always make this roll for the player. Note that the Thief and his or her party must try to be quiet in order for the Thief to use this ability.\nFinally, Thieves can perform a Sneak Attack any time they are behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the opponent doesn’t know the Thief is there. The GM may require a Move Silently or Hide roll to determine this. The Sneak Attack is made with a +4 attack bonus and does double damage if it is successful. A Thief usually can’t make a Sneak Attack on the same opponent twice in any given combat.\nThe Sneak Attack can be performed with any melee (but not missile) weapon, or may be performed bare-handed (in which case subduing damage is done). Also, the Sneak Attack can be performed with the “flat of the blade;” the bonuses and penalties cancel out, so the attack has a +0 attack bonus and does normal damage; the damage done in this case is subduing damage."

Some items may be lashed to the outside, and thus count toward the weight limit but not the volume limit. A Halfling’s backpack holds at most 30 pounds and/or 1½ cubic feet, but costs the same as a full-sized item.\nA Candle will shed light over a 5’ radius, with dim light extending 5’ further. A normal candle will burn about 3 turns per inch of height.\nChalk is useful for “blazing a trail” through a dungeon or ruin.\nHoly Water is explained in the Encounter section.\nIron Spikes are useful for spiking doors closed (or spiking them open) and may be used as crude pitons in appropriate situations.\nA Lantern will provide light covering a 30’ radius; dim light will extend about 20’ further. A lantern will consume a flask of oil in 18+1d6 turns. A Hooded Lantern allows the light to be hidden or revealed as the user pleases; in all other ways it performs as an ordinary lantern. A Bullseye Lantern projects a cone of light 30’ long and 30’ wide at the widest point, with dim light extending an additional 20’ beyond that point. This type of lantern is generally hooded.\nA Map or Scroll Case is a tubular oiled leather case used to carry maps, scrolls, or other paper items. The case will have a water-resistant (but not waterproof) cap which slides over the end, and a loop to allow the case to be hung from a belt or bandolier. A standard scroll case can hold up to 10 sheets of paper, or a single scroll of up to seven spells.\nA Mirror is useful in a dungeon environment for many reasons; for instance, it is the only way to look at a Medusa without being turned to stone. Mirrors are also useful for looking around corners, and can be used outdoors to send signals using reflected sunlight.\nA Quiver is an open container used to hold arrows. A Bolt Case is a similar sort of container for crossbow bolts. In either case, the standard capacity is 20 missiles. The length of a quiver or bolt case must match the length of the ammunition for it to be useful; therefore, there are longbow and shortbow quivers and light and heavy crossbow bolt cases. The price is the same for all types.\nDry Rations may consist of dry bread, hard cheese, dried fruit, nuts, beans, jerky, or any other food which will not “go bad” in less than about a month (if not longer). Dry rations are generally sold in quantities sufficient for one character for a week, and are packaged in waxed or oiled cloth to protect them.\nHemp Rope is ½ inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of 1,600 pounds. Safe working load for a rope is normally one-quarter of the breaking strength. One or more knots in a rope cut the breaking strength in half. This does not affect the safe working load, because knots are figured into the listed one-quarter ratio.\nSilk Rope is about 3/8 inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of 1,600 pounds, although it weighs considerably less than hemp rope. The notes regarding rope strength given for hemp rope, above, apply here also.\nA Large Sack will hold at most 40 pounds or 4 cubic feet of goods.\nA Small Sack will hold at most 20 pounds or 2 cubic feet of goods.\nA pair of Saddlebags will hold at most 10 pounds or 1 cubic foot of goods (divided evenly between both bags).\nThieves’ Picks and Tools are required for the use of Thief abilities such as opening locks and removing traps. These abilities may not be usable without appropriate tools, or may be used at a penalty at the option of the Game Master.\nA Tinderbox is generally purchased with a flint and steel; the flint, a piece of hard rock, is struck vigorously against a C-shaped piece of high-carbon steel. When done correctly, hot sparks will fly from the flint and steel into the tinder, hopefully starting a fire. The best tinder is a dried piece of prepared tinder fungus, carried in the tinderbox to keep it dry; char cloth, hemp rope, or even very dry grass can substitute if prepared tinder fungus is not available. The time required to start a fire should be determined by the GM according to the prevailing conditions; under ideal conditions, starting a fire with a flint, steel and tinder takes about a turn.\nA Torch sheds light over a 30’ radius, with dim light extending about 20’ further, and burns for 1d4+4 turns. Of course, a torch is also useful for setting flammable materials (such as cobwebs or oil) alight.\nA Whetstone is used to sharpen and maintain edged weapons such as swords, daggers, and axes.\nWineskin/Waterskin is a container for drinking water or wine; though generally water is taken into a dungeon or wilderness environment. The standard waterskin holds one quart of liquid, which is the minimum amount required by a normal character in a single day. If adventuring in the desert or other hot, dry areas, a character may need as much as ten times this amount. Note that the given 2 pound weight is for a full skin; an empty skin has negligible weight."

Dwarves, due to their stocky, powerful builds, are able to use Medium weapons one-handed and some Large weapons in two hands, but Large weapons more than four feet in length are prohibited (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and longbows). Some weapons must be used with both hands by design (such as bows and crossbows) but the maximum size limits still apply.\nThe GM should apply similar limitations to weapon-armed monsters; for instance, kobolds and goblins are similar in size to Halflings, and thus should have similar weapon limits."

    "text": "Notes Regarding Vehicles\nThe Crew figure given reflects the minimum number of sailors and/or rowers needed to operate the ship. Officers are not counted among these numbers, and of course it is always a good idea to hire extra sailors and/or rowers to ensure that any casualties will not slow down the ship.\nCargo for wagons is given in pounds, while for ships it is given in tons. If the ship sails night and day, each passenger requires living space equivalent to one ton of cargo; in addition, provisions for one man for one month occupy 1/10 of a ton of space.\nMovement is given separately here in feet (yards, actually; see Time and Scale for an explanation) as well as miles per day. The encounter movement of ships is not directly related to the long-distance travel rate, since the crew must work hard to make the ship move quickly in combat, and this level of effort cannot be maintained day and night.\nThe parenthesized figure represents maneuverability; see Maneuverability in Part 5: The Encounter for details.\nSee Attacking a Vehicle, also in the Encounter section, for details on the Hardness and HP statistics.\nA chariot requires a single horse, generally a warhorse, to pull it. Both coaches and wagons require at least a pair of draft horses to pull them.\nA caravel is a highly maneuverable sailing ship with two or three masts. Though superficially similar to the larger carrack, caravels are capable of sailing up rivers, a task for which the larger ship is ill suited.\nA carrack is a large, ocean-going sailing ship with three or four masts.\nGalleys are equipped with both sails and oars; the second listed movement rate for galleys is the rowing speed. A small galley will have around 20 rows of oars, with each oar pulled by two men (for a total of 80 rowers) while a large galley will have around 35 rows of oars (for a total of 140 rowers). Galleys are generally much more maneuverable than sailing ships such as the carrack or caravel, and may be outfitted with rams.\nThe longship commonly used by northern raiders is very similar to the large galley. However, where more civilized nations have specialist rowers, sailors, and marines, the crew of a longship is more generalized; most crewmen will be qualified for all of these tasks."

A siege engine that throws missiles (a ballista, onager or trebuchet) must have a trained artillerist to fire it; this is the character who makes the attack rolls for the weapon. Missile-throwing engines have attack penalties, detailed below. Note: siege engines are not generally usable against individuals or monsters; the GM may make exceptions for very large monsters like giants or dragons.

It is usually mounted on a tripod or wagon, but may also be mounted on a ship. When firing bolts, a ballista cannot damage brick or stone. A ballista requires a crew of three to operate.\nBattering Ram: These are usually operated under a sow (a sort of portable roof). They require a crew of eight or more.\nOnager: This weapon throws a stone with a fairly flat trajectory. An onager requires a crew of four to operate.\nScrew: This device may be used to attack a stronghold, by means of boring through the walls. A crew of at least eight is required to operate it. It is only used at the base of a wall, and it is usually operated under a sow.\nSow: This is a kind of portable roof, used for protection while performing slower attacks on a fortified building. Those under a sow will be harder to hit, receiving at least a +6 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks while taking cover under it. The sow itself has a hardness of 9 and 50 hit points.\nTrebuchet: This mighty weapon uses a counterweight to fling a stone on a high, arcing path. It cannot fire at targets within 200 yards. If it is aimed at a target that is more than 20’ higher than the weapon, there is an additional –2 attack penalty. A trebuchet requires a crew of eight to operate."

    "title": "8  Spells",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The number of spells of each level which a Cleric or Magic-User may cast per day is shown on the appropriate table in the Classes section. Each day, usually in the morning, spellcasters prepare spells to replace those they have used. Clerics do this through prayer, while Magic-Users must study their spellbooks. Spells prepared but not used persist from day to day; only those actually cast must be replaced. A spellcaster may always choose to dismiss a prepared spell (without casting it) in order to prepare a different spell of that level.\nSpellcasters must have at least one hand free, and be able to speak, in order to cast spells; thus, binding and gagging a spellcaster is an effective means of preventing him or her from casting spells. In combat, casting a spell usually takes the same time as making an attack. If a spellcaster is attacked (even if not hit) or must make a saving throw (whether successful or not) on the Initiative number on which he or she is casting a spell, the spell is spoiled and lost. As a specific exception, two spell casters releasing their spells at each other on the same Initiative number will both succeed in their casting; one caster may disrupt another with a spell only if he or she has a better Initiative, and chooses to delay casting the spell until right before the other caster.\nSome spells are reversible; such spells are shown with an asterisk after the name.\n\nCleric Spells\nClerics receive their spells through faith and prayer. Each day, generally in the morning, a Cleric must pray for at least three turns in order to prepare spells. Of course, the Cleric may be expected to pray more than this in order to remain in his or her deity’s good graces.\nBecause they gain their spells through prayer, a Cleric may prepare any spell of any level he or she is able to cast. However, in some cases the Cleric’s deity may limit the availability of certain spells; for instance, a deity devoted to healing may refuse to grant reversed healing spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Light Wounds*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1\nRange: touch\nDuration: instantaneous\nWith this spell the caster heals 1d6+1 hit points of damage by laying his or her hand upon the injured creature.\nThe reverse form of this spell, cause light wounds, causes 1d6+1 damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack roll is required in this case.\nUndead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by cure light wounds and healed by cause light wounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Evil*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nCleric 1, Magic-User 2\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of evil nature. Normal characters, even “bad” characters, cannot be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is detectable. The caster sees the “evil” creatures or objects with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else.\nThe exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide. Note that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not “evil,” and thus not detectable by this spell.\nReversed, this spell becomes detect good, which works just as described above with respect to detecting “good” enchantments, angelic creatures, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nCleric 1, Magic-User 1\nDuration: 2 turns\nThe caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack penalty of only -2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 120’\nCleric 1, Magic-User 1\nDuration: 6 turns + 1/level\nThis spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates a 30’ radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20’) around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.\nReversed, light becomes darkness, creating an area of darkness just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision and negates mundane light sources.\nA light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing ambient light level.\nEither version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target’s ocular organs. The target is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A light or darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the victim).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection from Evil*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of “evil” is left to the individual GM to decide.\nSecond, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are “evil” or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.\nReversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are kept away, rather than “evil” creatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurify Food and Water\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1\nRange: 10’\nDuration: instantaneous\nThis spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Fear*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch (120’)\nCleric 1\nDuration: instantaneous\n(2 turns)\nThis spell will calm the creature touched. If the target creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it is allowed a new save vs. Spells to resist that fear, at a bonus of +1 per level of the caster.\nThe reverse of this spell, cause fear, causes one target creature within 120’ to become frightened; if the target fails to save vs. Spells, it flees for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or more hit dice are immune to this effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResist Cold\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 1\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold. Minor cold (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate clothing) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant cold (such as the breath of a White Dragon), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBless*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 50’ radius\nCleric 2\nDuration: 1 minute/level\nThis spell gives the caster and his or her allies (within a 50’ radius of the caster) a bonus of +1 on attack rolls, morale checks (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear.\nThe reverse of bless is called bane. It fills the caster’s enemies (within a 50’ radius) with fear and doubt, causing each affected creature to suffer a –1 penalty on attack rolls, morale checks, and saving throws against magical fear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharm Animal\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nCleric 2\nDuration: level+1d4 rounds\nThis spell allows the caster to charm one or more animals, in much the same fashion as charm person, at a rate of 1 hit die per caster level. The caster may decide which individual animals out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess hit dice of effect are ignored. No saving throw is allowed, either for normal or giant-sized animals, but creatures of more fantastic nature (as determined by the GM) are allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the animals will resume normal activity immediately.\nThis spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected animals; if combined with speak with animals, this spell becomes significantly more useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Traps\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nCleric 2\nDuration: 3 turns\nThis spell permits the caster to detect a variety of traps, both mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30’ of a trap, he or she will see it glow with a faint greenish-blue aura. The caster is not, however, able to detect certain natural hazards such as quicksand, a sinkhole, or unsafe walls of natural rock. The spell also does not bestow the caster with the knowledge needed to disarm the trap, nor any details about its type or nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold Person\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 180’\nCleric 2, Magic-User 3\nDuration: 2d8 turns\nThis spell will render any living (not undead) human, demi-human or humanoid creature paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will not be affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are aware, and breathe normally, but cannot take any actions, including speech. A successful save vs. Spells will negate the effect. The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes his or her save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures in the group may be affected.\nA winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls (if in flight at the time). A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResist Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 2\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to fire and heat. Minor heat or fire (such as exposure to normal flames) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant heat or fire (such as a fireball), the affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilence 15’ Radius\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2\nRange: 360’\nDuration: 2 rounds/level\nUpon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within a 15’ radius around the target. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, making the effect stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a save vs. Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another creature’s possession is targeted, that creature also receives a save vs. Spells to negate. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Animals\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 2\nRange: special\nDuration: 1 turn/4 levels\nThe caster can comprehend and communicate with any one animal (normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which animal he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. The spell doesn’t alter the animal’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward the caster, it may be willing to grant some favor or service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpiritual Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nCleric 2\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell causes a warhammer made of pure force to spring into existence, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within range once per round. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the caster’s normal attack bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by magic weapons. If the hammer goes beyond the spell range, the Cleric loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it, the hammer disappears. The hammer cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, or a rod of cancellation will dispel it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinual Light*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 360’\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nDuration: 1 year/level\nThis spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full daylight up to a 30’ radius, with light of lesser intensity to a radius of 60’. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the light spell, up to a maximum range of 360’ from the caster. The spell remains in effect for one year per level of the caster.\nAs with light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded creature’s attack rolls if the saving throw fails.\nThe reversed spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind in the same way as continual light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Blindness\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 3\nDuration: instantaneous\nWith this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering blindness (whether caused by injury or by magic, including light or continual light). Blindness caused by a curse cannot be cured by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Disease*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 3\nDuration: instantaneous\nCure disease cures all diseases that the subject is suffering from. The spell also kills parasites afflicting the target creature. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.\nNote: This spell does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth of Animals\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 3\nRange: 60’+10’/level\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell causes an animal to grow to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will do double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its existing natural Armor Class increases by 2. The animal’s carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save vs. Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused or panicky afterward (at the GM’s discretion).\nAll equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its normal size.\nThe spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate Object\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 360’\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. He or she can search for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that particular item firsthand (not merely through divination such as clairvoyance or a crystal ball). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Curse*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nCleric 3, Magic-User 4\nDuration: instantaneous\nRemove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be removed only by a caster of a certain level.\nThe reverse of this spell, bestow curse, allows the caster to place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following three effects:\n–4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).\n–4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.\nEach round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.\nThe caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Dead\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 10’\nCleric 3\nDuration: 3 rounds/level\nThis spell grants the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that the caster puts to it. The caster may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive.\nIf the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. The caster can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.\nThis spell does not let the caster actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge “stored” in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can’t even remember being questioned.\nThis spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStriking\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 3\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6 points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It provides no attack bonus, but if cast on a normal weapon, the spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such a monster, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 4, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimate Dead\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 4, Magic-User 5\nDuration: special\nThis spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster’s spoken commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or her level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Water\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 10’\nCleric 4\nDuration: permanent\nThis spell creates one gallon of water per caster level. Note that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available at the time of casting. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water. Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon, and one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCure Serious Wounds*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4\nRange: touch\nDuration: instantaneous\nThis spell works exactly like cure light wounds, save that it heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. The reverse, cause serious wounds, also works exactly like cause light wounds, except that it inflicts 2d6 + caster level in damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDispel Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 120’\nCleric 4, Magic-User 3\nDuration: instantaneous\nThe caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within a cubic area 20’ on a side. The caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.\nIf dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than the dispel magic caster’s level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a 20% chance of failure.\nSome spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically includes any curse, including those created by bestow curse (the reverse of remove curse) as well as by cursed items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutralize Poison*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 4\nDuration: instantaneous\nThis spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.\nReversed, this spell becomes poison. The caster must make a successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target must save vs. Poison or die. The caster’s touch remains poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection from Evil 10’ radius*\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Plants\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 20’\nCleric 4\nDuration: 1 turn\nThe caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal plants and plant creatures. A normal plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn’t alter the plant’s reaction or attitude towards the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse and evasive, behaving in much the same fashion as any other monster. If a plant creature is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Normal plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally perform “services” other than to answer questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSticks to Snakes\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 120’\nCleric 4\nDuration: 6 turns\nThis spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster levels. (See the Monsters section for details on types of snakes.) The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to their original stick form. Magical “sticks” such as enchanted staves cannot be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 5, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommune\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: self\nCleric 5\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell puts the caster in contact with his patron deity or an extraplanar servant thereof, who answers one yes-or-no question per caster level. The ritual to cast this spell takes 1 turn to complete. The being contacted may or may not be omniscient, and further, though the being is technically allied with the caster, it may still not answer questions clearly or completely. These details are left to the GM’s discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Food\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 10’\nCleric 5\nDuration: permanent\nThe food that this spell creates is simple fare of the caster’s choice, highly nourishing, but rather bland. Up to 3 men or one horse per caster level can be fed for one day with this spell. Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting purify food and water on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDispel Evil\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 5\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis powerful spell aids the caster in dealing with creatures from the nether planes, hereafter called “evil creatures.”\nFirst, the caster gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against attacks by evil creatures.\nSecond, the caster can choose to drive an evil creature back to its home plane by touch (requiring a successful attack roll). The creature can negate the effects with a successful save vs. Spells. This use discharges and ends the spell, even if the saving throw succeeds.\nThird, with a touch the caster can automatically dispel any one spell cast by an evil creature. Exception: Spells that can’t be dispelled by dispel magic also can’t be dispelled by dispel evil. Saving throws do not apply to this effect. This use also ends the spell.\nThe exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide; however, extraplanar creatures that oppose the caster should almost always qualify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsect Plague\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 300’+30’/level\nCleric 5\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level. See Insect Swarm in the Monsters section for the effects of a swarm. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). The caster may summon the locust swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuest*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 5’/level\nCleric 5\nDuration: special\nQuest places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.\nA saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.\nThe affected creature must follow the given instructions until the quest is completed, no matter how long it takes.\nIf the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.\nIf the subject is prevented from obeying the quest for 24 hours, it takes 3d6 points of damage each day.\nA quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel magic does not affect a quest spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaise Dead*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 5\nDuration: instantaneous\nThis spell restores life to a deceased human, demi-human or humanoid. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is raised, permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.\nAlso note, a character who died with spells prepared has none prepared upon being raised.\nA raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current hit dice. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.\nA creature which has become undead can’t be raised by this spell. Constructs and elementals cannot be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.\nThe reverse of this spell, slay living, will kill instantly the creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a human, demi-human or humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If the saving throw is successful, 2d6 damage is dealt to the victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell in combat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Seeing\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 5\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell confers on the target the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.\nTrue seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairvoyance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 180’\nCleric 5, Magic-User 4\nDuration: 1 round/level\n(or special)\nAn immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on the caster’s turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points +1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.\nThe wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20’ in length per caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5’ per caster level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20’ tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).\nIf the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10’ of the wall.\nThe caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 6, Clerical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimate Objects\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nCleric 6\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell imbues inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated objects then attack whomever or whatever the caster designates. This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. An animated object can be of any non-magical material. The caster can animate one object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level (i.e. 300 lbs. at 12th level, 325 lbs. at 13th level, and so on).\nThe GM must rule on the effectiveness of animated objects in combat. In general, animated objects attack using the same attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM’s discretion). As a special case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated objects have a movement rate of 10’, and generally must move in contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the GM).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlade Barrier\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 90’\nCleric 6\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell creates a wall of whirling blades up to 20’ long per caster level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5’ per two levels. Either form will be up to 20 ft. high (as allowed by available space). Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a save vs. Death Ray reducing damage to half.\nIf the caster evokes the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful save vs. Death Ray.\nA blade barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to Armor Class) against attacks made through it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the Path\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 6\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination. The caster must have some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described to the caster. Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.\nThe locale can be outdoors or underground. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. The location must be on the same plane as the caster at the time of casting.\nThe spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to detect secret doors and to know any passwords required. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeal*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 6\nDuration: permanent\nHeal enables the caster to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blindness, confusion, deafness, disease, exhaustion or fatigue, feeblemind, insanity, nausea, and poison. It also restores all but 1d4 of the target’s hit points. Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.\nThe reversed spell, harm, injures the creature touched so horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which harm may kill a creature).\nGenerally, both heal and harm only affect living creatures. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm; likewise, harm affects undead like heal. Constructs such as golems are unaffected by either spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegenerate\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 6\nDuration: permanent\nThis spell causes the subject’s severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is required for the regeneration to complete.\nThis spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no effect on nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestoration\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 6\nDuration: permanent\nEach casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a creature who has suffered energy drain. At 16th level, two negative levels may be removed. See the rules for Energy Drain (in the Encounter section) for more details.\nAlternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability score points. If applied to a character who has suffered temporary loss of ability points, it will restore up to 1d4 lost points to any one drained ability immediately. If applied to a character who has suffered permanent loss of ability points, 1 point can be restored.\nRestoration does not restore levels lost due to death (as described for the spell raise dead).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeak with Monsters\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 6\nRange: special\nDuration: 1 turn/5 levels\nThe caster can comprehend and communicate with any one monster that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster may change which monster he or she is speaking with at will, once per round. Others able to understand the language spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to understand the caster. The spell doesn’t alter the monster’s reaction or attitude towards the caster. Furthermore, more intelligent monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. If a monster is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Mindless monsters, plant creatures and undead are unaffected by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord of Recall\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: self (special)\nCleric 6\nDuration: instantaneous\nWord of recall teleports the caster instantly back to his or her sanctuary when a single word is uttered. The caster must designate the sanctuary when he or she prepares the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. The caster can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).\nAn unwilling creature can’t be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its possession from being teleported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic User Spells\nMagic-Users cast spells through the exercise of knowledge and will. They prepare spells by study of their spellbooks; each Magic-User has his or her own spellbook containing the magical formulae for each spell the Magic-User has learned. Spellbooks are written in a magical script that can only be read by the one who wrote it, or through the use of the spell read magic. All Magic-Users begin play knowing read magic, and it is so ingrained that it can be prepared without a spellbook.\nA Magic-User may only prepare spells after resting (i.e. a good night’s sleep), and needs one turn per each three spell levels to do so (rounding fractions up). Spells prepared but not used on a previous day are not lost. For example, a 3rd level Magic-User preparing all three of his or her available spells (two 1st level and one 2nd level) is preparing a total of 4 levels of spells, and thus needs 2 turns (4 divided by 3 and rounded up).\nRules for the acquisition of new spells are found in the Game Master’s section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1, Magic User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharm Person\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nMagic User 1\nDuration: special\nThis spell makes a humanoid creature of 4 hit dice or less regard the caster as its trusted friend and ally. Humans and demi-humans may be affected, regardless of level of ability. A save vs. Spells will negate the effect. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by the caster or his or her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton; rather, it perceives his or her words and actions in the most favorable way. The caster can try to give the subject orders, but it will not do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do, and further may receive an additional saving throw to overcome the magic (at the GM’s discretion). The caster must speak the target’s language to communicate any commands, or else be good at pantomiming; of course, if the caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect its “friend” (though that could mean attacking the caster’s enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster to a “safe” place). The target receives a new saving throw each day if it has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its Intelligence is 9-12, or every month if its Intelligence is 8 or less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nCleric 1, Magic-User 1\nDuration: 2 turns\nThe caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack penalty of only -2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloating Disk\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 0\nMagic User 1\nDuration: 5 turns +1/level\nThis spell creates an invisible, slightly concave circular plane of force for carrying loads. It is about the size of a shield, being 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold a maximum of 500 pounds of weight. (Note that water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon.) The disc must be loaded so that the items placed upon it are properly supported, or they will (of course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over 62 gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other reasonable container that can be placed upon the disc. Similarly, a pile of loose coins will tend to slip and slide about, and some will fall off with every step the caster takes; but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain stable.\nThe disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the caster’s waist. It remains still when within 10’ of the caster, and follows at the caster’s movement rate if he or she moves away from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to position it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than 10’ from the caster. When the spell duration expires, the disc disappears from existence and drops whatever was supported to the surface beneath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold Portal\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nMagic User 1\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A knock spell or a successful dispel magic spell can negate a hold portal spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 120’\nCleric 1, Magic-User 1\nDuration: 6 turns + 1/level\nThis spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates a 30’ radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20’) around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.\nReversed, light becomes darkness, creating an area of darkness just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision and negates mundane light sources.\nA light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing ambient light level.\nEither version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target’s ocular organs. The target is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A light or darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the victim).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Missile\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nMagic User 1\nDuration: instantaneous\nThis spell causes a missile of magical energy to dart forth from the caster’s fingertip and strike its target, which must be at least partially visible to the caster, dealing 1d6+1 points of damage. The missile strikes unerringly. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.\nFor every three caster levels beyond 1st, an additional missile is fired – two at 4th level, three at 7th, four at 10th, and the maximum of five missiles at 13th level or higher. If the caster fires multiple missiles, he or she can target a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. Targets must be designated before damage is rolled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Mouth\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nMagic User 1\nDuration: special\nThis spell imbues the chosen non-living object with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which may be up to three words per caster level long, can be in any language known by the caster and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes, at any volume from a whisper to a yell. The voice will resemble the caster’s, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use command words or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object.\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the caster’s command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or class except by external garb.\nThe range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 60 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection from Evil*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 1, Magic-User 1\nRange: touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.\nFirst, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of “evil” is left to the individual GM to decide.\nSecond, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are “evil” or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.\nReversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are kept away, rather than “evil” creatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Languages\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 0\nMagic User 1\nDuration: special\nThis spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any written language. It may be cast in one of three modes:\nIn the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any number of written works in a variety of languages. This mode lasts for 1 turn per caster level.\nIn the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one book or tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.\nIn the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one non-magical scroll or other single-sheet document; this mode is permanent.\nThis spell does not work on any sort of magical text, such as spell scrolls or spellbooks; see read magic, below, for the correct spell to use in such cases.\nThe spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts the caster doesn’t otherwise have the ability to understand. Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one living creature that can read the given language somewhere on the same plane. The knowledge is not copied from that creature’s mind; rather, it is the existence of the knowledge that enables the spell to function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 0\nMagic User 1\nDuration: permanent\nWhen cast upon any magical text, such as a spellbook or magic-user spell scroll, this spell enables the caster to read that text. Casting this spell on a cursed text will generally trigger the curse. All Magic-Users begin play knowing this spell, and it can be prepared even if the Magic-User loses access to his or her spellbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShield\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: self\nMagic User 1\nDuration: 5 rounds+1/level\nShield creates an invisible, shield-like mobile disk of force that hovers in front of the caster. It negates magic missile attacks directed at the caster, and improves the caster’s Armor Class by +3 vs. melee attacks and +6 vs. missile weapons. The Armor Class benefits do not apply to attacks originating from behind the caster, but magic missiles are warded off from all directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 90’\nMagic User 1\nDuration: 5 rounds/level\nThis spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice into a magical slumber. Creatures of 4 or more hit dice are not affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell (within the given range, of course), and those creatures within 30’ of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the effect.\nSleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures, and such creatures in the area of effect are ignored.\nWhen the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue sleeping normally, at the GM’s option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVentriloquism\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nMagic User 1\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell allows the caster to cause his or her voice to sound from someplace else within range, for example, from a dark alcove or statue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2, Magic User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinual Light*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 360’\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nDuration: 1 year/level\nThis spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full daylight up to a 30’ radius, with light of lesser intensity to a radius of 60’. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the light spell, up to a maximum range of 360’ from the caster. The spell remains in effect for one year per level of the caster.\nAs with light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded creature’s attack rolls if the saving throw fails.\nThe reversed spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind in the same way as continual light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Evil*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nCleric 1, Magic-User 2\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of evil nature. Normal characters, even “bad” characters, cannot be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is detectable. The caster sees the “evil” creatures or objects with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else.\nThe exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide. Note that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not “evil,” and thus not detectable by this spell.\nReversed, this spell becomes detect good, which works just as described above with respect to detecting “good” enchantments, angelic creatures, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect Invisible\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nMagic User 2\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nBy means of this spell the caster is able to see invisible characters, creatures or objects within the given range, seeing them as translucent shapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvisibility\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nMagic User 2\nDuration: special\nThe creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, including Darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If the spell is cast on someone else, neither the caster nor his or her allies can see the subject, unless they can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.\nItems dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).\nThe spell ends if the subject attacks any creature or casts any spell. Actions (other than spellcasting) directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. The spell lasts at most 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnock\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nMagic User 2\nDuration: special\nThe knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or wizard locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold shut something which can be opened). If used to open a wizard locked door, the spell does not remove the wizard lock but simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock will not raise a portcullis or operate any other similar mechanism, nor will it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Each spell can undo a single means of preventing access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevitate\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nMagic User 2\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nLevitate allows the caster to move himself or herself, another creature, or an object up and down as desired. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. The caster can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round, by concentration. The caster cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its normal land speed).\nA levitating creature that attacks with a weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 attack penalty, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate Object\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 360’\nCleric 3, Magic-User 2\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. He or she can search for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that particular item firsthand (not merely through divination such as clairvoyance or a crystal ball). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMind Reading\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nMagic User 2\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell, sometimes incorrectly called ESP, permits the caster to hear (and possibly see, if the target visualizes anything) the surface thoughts of one or more living creatures within range. The caster must designate a direction or select a visible target, and then concentrate for a turn in order to “hear” the thoughts. Each turn the caster may choose to “listen” in a different direction. The caster may stop listening, then resume again later, so long as the duration has not expired. The target creature is not normally aware of being spied upon in this way, though any creature already under the effect of this spell or any similar form of telepathy will instantly know and be able to sense the direction of the caster.\nRock more than 2 inches thick or a thin coating of lead or gold will block the spell. All undead creatures are immune to this effect, as are mindless creatures such as golems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMirror Image\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: self\nMagic User 2\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell creates several illusory duplicates of the caster. The images move through each other as well as the real caster more or less constantly, making it impossible for most creatures to determine which is real. A total of 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These figments separate from the caster and remain in a cluster around him or her. The figments mimic the caster’s actions, pretending to cast spells, drink potions, levitate, and so on, just as the caster does. Figments always look exactly like the caster.\nEnemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will always hit a figment instead. Any attack against an image destroys it, whether the attack roll is successful or not; likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a figment will destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Area-effect spells are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect all figments exactly as they affect the caster; for instance, if the caster is subjected to a fireball, all figments will appear to be injured just as the caster was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhantasmal Force\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 180’\nMagic User 2\nDuration: concentration\nThis spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature (or small group of creatures), or other effect, as visualized by the caster up to a maximum size of 20’x20’x20’. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The caster can animate the image within the limits of the area of effect. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates upon it.\nIf used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they will have an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in combat. Damage done by monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this spell is not real; those “killed” or otherwise apparently disabled will wake up uninjured (at least from this spell) after 2d8 rounds. The illusory damage done will be equivalent to the normal damage for any attack form simulated.\nAttempting to animate more creatures than the caster’s level grants viewing creatures with at least average Intelligence an immediate save vs. Spells to recognize the creatures as illusions; those making the save will be unaffected by any actions taken by the illusions from that point on. A similar save may be granted by the GM any time he or she feels the illusion is likely to be seen through, especially if the player describes an illusion which seems improbable or otherwise poorly conceived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 10’ per level\nMagic User 2\nDuration: 2 turns/level\nWeb creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands, filling a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight 10’x10’x10’ cubes). The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected area will.\nAnyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again.\nIf the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.\nThe strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away a 10’ cube in 1 round; the fire will spread to adjacent 10’ cubes each round until all the webbing is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means). All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWizard Lock\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 20’\nMagic User 2\nDuration: permanent\nA wizard lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. The caster can freely pass his or her own wizard lock without affecting it, as can any Magic-User 3 or more levels higher than the caster of the wizard lock; otherwise, a door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful dispel magic or knock spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3, Magic User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClairvoyance\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nMagic User 3\nDuration: 12 turns\nThis spell enables the caster to see into another area through the eyes of a living creature in that area. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 60’ away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target creature is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn has passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkvision\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nMagic User 3\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThe subject receives Darkvision with a range of 60’ for the duration of the spell. (See page 37 for details.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDispel Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 120’\nCleric 4, Magic-User 3\nDuration: instantaneous\nThe caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within a cubic area 20’ on a side. The caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.\nIf dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than the dispel magic caster’s level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a 20% chance of failure.\nSome spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically includes any curse, including those created by bestow curse (the reverse of remove curse) as well as by cursed items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFireball\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nMagic User 3\nDuration: instantaneous\nA fireball spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level to every creature within a spherical volume having a 20’ radius. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The explosion creates almost no pressure.\nThe caster points a finger and determines the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, he or she must roll a missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit the opening, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.\nThe fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFly\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nMagic User 3\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe subject of this spell can fly at a speed equal to his or her normal ground movement rate (as adjusted by encumbrance). The subject can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, with the same maneuverability as the subject has when moving on the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither charge nor run, nor carry aloft more weight than his or her maximum load.\nShould the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 120’ per round for 1d10 rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in that amount of time, he or she lands safely. If not, the subject falls the rest of the distance, taking normal falling damage. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the fly spell is dispelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaste*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’+10’/level\nMagic User 3\nDuration: 1 round/level\nThis spell accelerates the actions of 1 creature per caster level. The affected creatures move and act twice as quickly as normal, having double their normal movement rates and making twice the normal attacks per round, for the duration of the spell. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic items such as wands, which may still be used just once per round. Multiple haste or speed effects don’t combine; only apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.\nReversed, haste becomes slow; affected creatures move at half speed, attacking half as often (generally, every other round) and making half a normal move each round. Naturally, target creatures may save vs. Spells to avoid the effect. Haste and slow counter and dispel each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold Person\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 180’\nCleric 2, Magic-User 3\nDuration: 2d8 turns\nThis spell will render any living (not undead) human, demi-human or humanoid creature paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will not be affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are aware, and breathe normally, but cannot take any actions, including speech. A successful save vs. Spells will negate the effect. The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes his or her save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures in the group may be affected.\nA winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls (if in flight at the time). A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvisibility 10’ radius\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic User 3\nRange: touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell functions like invisibility, except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.\nThose affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves, but if the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility ends for all affected creatures. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible (including any previously affected creatures who have become visible as described above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightning Bolt\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 50’+10’/level\nMagic User 3\nDuration: instantaneous\nThis spell releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level to each creature within its area. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The bolt begins at the caster’s fingertips and extends to the range given. The caster may choose to limit the range of the spell, but the minimum range is 60 feet. The lightning bolt passes through an area 5’ wide, arcing and jumping, so that, while it is not actually 5’ wide, for game purposes treat it as if it is so.\nThe lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the GM’s option. Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection from Evil 10’ Radius*\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric 4, Magic-User 3\nRange: touch\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell functions exactly as protection from evil, but with a 10’ radius rather than a 1’ radius. All within the radius receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as well.\nReversed, this spell becomes protection from good 10’ radius, and functions exactly as the reversed form of protection from evil, except that it covers a 10’ radius around the target rather than the normal 1’ radius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection from Normal Missiles\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic User 3\nRange: self\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThe caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical missile attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or other such are not blocked, but any number of normal arrows, sling bullets, crossbow bolts, thrown daggers, etc. will be fended off. Note that normal missiles projected by magic bows count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Breathing\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nMagic User 3\nDuration: 2 hours/level\nThe affected creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures the caster touches. The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 4, Magic User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharm Monster\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nMagic User 4\nDuration: special\nThis spell functions like charm person, except that the effect is not restricted by creature type or size. Undead monsters are unaffected. This spell can affect 3d6 hit dice of creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice, or one creature of more than 3 hit dice. Saving throws are made just as for charm person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfusion\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 360’\nMagic User 4\nDuration: 2 rounds+1/level\nThis spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30’ radius circle around the target point to become confused,making them unable to independently determine what they will do. A saving throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Roll on the following table on each subject’s Initiative number each round to see what the subject does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd20\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\n1–2\nAttack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible).\n\n\n3–4\nAct normally.\n\n\n5–10\nDo nothing but babble incoherently.\n\n\n11–14\nFlee away from caster at top possible speed.\n\n\n15–20\nAttack nearest creature.\n\n\n\nA confused character who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically retaliates on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension Door\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 10’\nMagic User 4\nDuration: instantaneous\nThe caster of this spell instantly transfers himself or herself, or any single target creature within range, to any spot within 200’ plus 20’ per caster level. The caster or target creature always arrives at exactly the spot desired, whether the caster visualizes the area or states direction and distance. An unwilling target may save vs. Spells to avoid being transported. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target creature will be transported also, including another character or creature if the transportee can lift it. If the target area is within a solid object, the spell fails automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth of Plants*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 120’\nMagic User 4\nDuration: permanent\nThis spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become thick and overgrown. The dimensions of the growth are determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1000 sq. feet (a 10’x100’ area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. All movement within the affected area is reduced to no more than 5’ per round for less than giant sized creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal movement rate. The area must have brush and/or trees in it for this spell to take effect.\nThe reverse form, shrink plants, may be used to render overgrown areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal version.\nGrowth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered, either by the opposite form or by dispel magic. This spell has no effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHallucinatory Terrain\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic User 4\nRange: 400’+40’/level\nDuration: 12 turns/level\nThis spell makes one 10 yard cube per level of outdoor terrain appear like a different type (i.e. field into forest, grassland into desert, or the like). This spell requires a full turn to cast.\nThe affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance. A save vs. Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the creatures or characters affected actively attempt to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIce Storm\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 300’+30’/level\nMagic User 4\nDuration: 1 round\nThis spell causes great magical hailstones to pound down for 1 full round, dealing 5d6 points of damage to every creature in a 20’ radius around the target spot; a successful save vs. Spells will reduce damage by half. The ice storm fills a vertical volume of 40’, so creatures higher than that distance above the target spot are unaffected. A –20% penalty applies to each Listen roll made within the ice storm’s effect, and all land movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt). Any creature naturally resistant to cold takes half damage (or one-quarter damage if it makes its save).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassmorph\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nMagic User 4\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nWith this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man-sized (or smaller) creatures per four caster levels to appear as if they are natural effects of the terrain (for example, trees in a forest, stalagmites in a cave, coral underwater, boulders in a cavern, etc.). All creatures to be affected must be within a 120’ radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include himself or herself among the affected creatures.\nThose affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing through the area for so long as they remain still. If an affected creature chooses to move or attack, the illusion is dispelled for that creature, but those who remain still continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he or she wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion can also be ended by dispel magic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolymorph Other\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nMagic User 4\nDuration: permanent\nThis spell allows the caster to change one target into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than caster’s level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike polymorph self, the transformed target also gains the behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special, supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target may not remember its former life.\nThe target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, as noted above. A creature with shape changing abilities such as a doppleganger can revert to its natural form in one round.\nUnwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are not affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the creature is slain, at which time the target reverts to his or her original form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolymorph Self\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: self\nMagic User 4\nDuration: 1 hour/level\nThis spell allows the caster to change into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than the caster’s level. The caster can’t assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. If slain, the caster reverts to his or her original form.\nThe caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form but retains his or her own mental abilities. He or she also gains all physical attacks possessed by the form but does not gain any special, supernatural or spell-like abilities. Dragon breath is a special ability, for instance, so were the caster to assume the form of a dragon he or she could use the dragon’s normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not the dragon’s breath.\nThe caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of ability, or may choose to end the spell whenever he or she desires (up to one hour per level, of course).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Curse*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nCleric 3, Magic-User 4\nDuration: instantaneous\nRemove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be removed only by a caster of a certain level.\nThe reverse of this spell, bestow curse, allows the caster to place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following three effects:\n–4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).\n–4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.\nEach round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.\nThe caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 180’\nCleric 5, Magic-User 4\nDuration: 1 round/level\n(or special)\nAn immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on the caster’s turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points +1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.\nThe wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20’ in length per caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5’ per caster level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20’ tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).\nIf the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall; a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10’ of the wall.\nThe caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWizard Eye\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 240’\nMagic User 4\nDuration: 6 turns\nWith this spell the caster creates an invisible magical “eye” through which he or she can see. The eye has Darkvision, but otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240’ away, and thereafter can move at a rate of 40’ per round as directed by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240’ feet away from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a normal human’s eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1 inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 5, Magic User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimate Dead\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nCleric 4, Magic-User 5\nDuration: special\nThis spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster’s spoken commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or her level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudkill\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 100’+10’/level\nMagic User 5\nDuration: 6 rounds/level\nThis spell creates a 20’x20’x20’ cloud of poison gas which moves at a rate of 10’ per round under the control of the caster (so long as he or she concentrates on it). The gas kills outright any creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice or levels it comes in contact with; creatures having 4 or more hit dice or levels must save vs. Poison or die. The cloud persists for the entire duration even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjure Elemental\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 240’\nMagic User 5\nDuration: special\nA portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental from that plane. At most one elemental of each type may be summoned by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature; spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only dispel magic or dispel evil will banish the elemental once control has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not choose to remain on the material plane for long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeblemind\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 180’\nMagic User 5\nDuration: permanent\nIf the target creature fails a saving throw vs. Spells, its Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. The victim does remember who its friends are and can follow and protect them from harm. The subject remains in this state until a heal spell is used to cancel the effect. A target creature that can cast Magic-User spells suffers a penalty of -4 on its saving throw against this spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold Monster\n\n\n\n\n\nThis spell functions like hold person, except that it affects any living creature that fails its save vs. Spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Jar\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nMagic User 5\nDuration: special\nBy casting magic jar, the caster places his or her soul in a gem or large crystal within spell range (known as the magic jar), leaving the body lifeless. The caster may then attempt to take control of a nearby living creature within spell range, forcing its soul into the magic jar. The caster may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when the caster’s soul returns to his or her own body, leaving the receptacle empty.\nTo cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and the caster must know where it is, though he or she does not need to be able to see it. When the caster transfers his or her soul upon casting, the caster’s body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body would.\nPossession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. The subject is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. Failure to take over the host leaves the caster’s life force in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell.\nIf the caster is successful, his or her life force occupies the host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. The caster keeps his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities (including spellcasting ability). The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow the caster to make more attacks than normal. The caster does not have access to any extraordinary or supernatural abilities of the body.\nIf the caster’s spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by dispel magic or physical damage): If the jar is in range of the caster’s body, the caster’s spirit returns to its body. Otherwise, the caster’s spirit departs (the caster dies). In either case, the spell ends.\nIf the caster’s spirit is driven from the host body by dispel evil: If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit returns to the jar, and the host’s spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit is freed from the jar (and departs), and the host’s body dies.\nIf the host’s spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken: If the jar is in range of the host’s body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the host’s spirit departs, and the caster’s spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel evil can still be used to drive the caster’s spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell.\nIn any case where the spell ends with the caster’s body unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPasswall\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’\nMagic User 5\nDuration: 3 turns\nPasswall creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is up to 10 feet deep plus an additional 10 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (20 feet at 12th, 30 feet deep at 15th, 40 feet deep at 18th). If the wall’s thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends (due to duration, dispel magic, or caster’s choice), creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelekinesis\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: self\nMagic User 5\nDuration: 3 turns\nThis spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by concentration alone. An object weighing no more than 50 pounds per caster level can be moved up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on itself or an object it holds or has on its body with a successful save vs. Death Ray. In order to use this power, the caster must maintain concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no running), making no attacks and casting no spells. If concentration is lost (whether intentional or not), the power may be used again on the next round, but the subject of the effect is allowed a new saving throw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeleport\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: self\nMagic User 5\nDuration: instantaneous\nThis spell instantly transports the caster to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature’s possession from being teleported.\nThe caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\nTo determine the results of this spell, roll d% and consult the table below. Below the table is an explanation of the terms used.\n\n\n\nFamiliarity\nOn Target\nOff Target\nSimilar Area\nMishap\n\n\n\n\nVery familiar\n01–97\n98–99\n100\n–\n\n\nStudied carefully\n01–94\n95–97\n98–99\n100\n\n\nSeen casually\n01–88\n89–94\n95–98\n99–100\n\n\nViewed once\n01–76\n77–88\n89–96\n97–100\n\n\nFalse destination\n–\n–\n81–92\n93–100\n\n\n\nFamiliarity: “Very familiar” is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. “Studied carefully” is a place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic.\n“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.\nOn Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.\nOff Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\nSimilar Area: The caster winds up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.\nMishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have gotten “scrambled.” Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Stone\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 15’ per level\nMagic User 5\nDuration: permanent\nThis spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall is composed of up to one 10’x10’ square section, 1’ thick, per caster level. The caster can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.\nThe caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape he or she desires. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell’s area by half. The wall can also be crudely shaped to create crenelations, battlements, and so forth by similarly reducing the area.\nLike any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.\nIt is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful saves vs. Death Ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 6, Magic User\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Magic Shell\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Magic Shell Range: 10’ radius\nMagic User 6\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nWithin a 10’ radius around the caster, all magic is negated for the full duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not affect the caster, magic items and spells within the radius are suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic until the spell has expired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Spell\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 240’\nMagic User 6\nDuration: instantaneous\nThis spell will kill 3d12 hit dice or levels of creatures in a 30’ radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within the range limit). Excess levels of effectiveness are lost. Each creature affected is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; those that fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or more hit dice or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters, golems, and any other “creature” that is not truly alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisintegrate\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 60’\nMagic User 6\nDuration: instantaneous\nThis spell causes a thin, green ray to spring from the caster’s pointing finger. Any single creature or object (up to a 10x10x10 foot cube of material) is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature’s equipment is unaffected.\nA creature that makes a successful save vs. Spells is unaffected. The ray can target only one creature per casting, if that target saves, the spell is wasted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlesh to Stone*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 30’/level\nMagic User 6\nDuration: permanent\nThis spell causes the subject, along with all its carried gear, to turn into a mindless, inert statue. A saving throw vs. Petrification is allowed to resist the spell. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) suffers equivalent damage or deformities. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.\nThe reverse spell, stone to flesh, acts as a counterspell for flesh to stone, restoring the creature just as it was when it was petrified. It does nothing if applied to stone that is not the result of flesh to stone or similar petrification effects (such as a medusa’s gaze).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeas*\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 5’ per level\nMagic User 6\nDuration: special\nGeas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.\nA saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.\nThe geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.\nIf the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his or her own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions, at the GM’s discretion.\nFor every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 3 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.\nA geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse spell, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel magic does not affect a geas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvisible Stalker\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 0\nMagic User 6\nDuration: special\nThe caster summons an invisible stalker to do his or her bidding (see the Monsters section, below, for details). The spell persists until dispel evil is cast on the creature, it is slain, or the task is fulfilled. The GM is advised to review the monster entry for the invisible stalker when this spell is used, as they may not always be reliable servants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower Water\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 360’\nMagic User 6\nDuration: 1 turn/level\nThis spell causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a more or less square-shaped depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (the reverse of haste); a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success negating the effect. The spell has no effect on other creatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjected Image\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 240’\nMagic User 6\nDuration: 6 turns\nThis spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster. The intangible projected image looks, sounds, and smells like the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions (including speech). Any further spells cast seem to originate from the illusion, not the actual caster. A line of sight between the caster and his or her illusory self must be maintained or the spell ends. Dimension door, teleport, or any similar spell that breaks the line of sight dispels the image, as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat. Note that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster; for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able to see something the caster can’t directly see, the caster does not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the caster’s actual position, not the illusory self’s position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReincarnate\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: touch\nMagic User 6\nDuration: instantaneous\nWith this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or humanoid creature) in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work.\nRoll on the following table to determine what sort of creature the character becomes:\n\n\n\nd%\nIncarnation\n\n\n\n\n01–02\nBugbear\n\n\n03–17\nDwarf\n\n\n18–28\nElf\n\n\n29\nGnoll\n\n\n30–39\nGnome\n\n\n40–44\nGoblin\n\n\n45–63\nHalfling\n\n\n64–88\nHuman\n\n\n89–92\nKobold\n\n\n93\nLizard Man\n\n\n94–98\nOrc\n\n\n99\nTroglodyte\n\n\n100\nOther (GM’s choice)\n\n\n\nSince the dead character is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the character’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the character’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.\nA reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character’s ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.) The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total from the character’s original hit point total; this is the new form’s hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.\nA character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age.\nThe reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Iron\n\n\n\n\n\nRange: 90’\nMagic User 6\nDuration: permanent\nThis spell causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall is composed of up to one 10’x10’ square section, one inch thick, per caster level. If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the ground.\nThe caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush larger creatures.\nLike any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena."

Such undead monsters persist until slain, and obey the verbal commands of the caster. A single casting of this spell may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to twice the caster’s level of ability, and no more. Animated skeletons have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for skeletons of members of player character races, this means one hit die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more hit die than the creature had in life.\nThe sort of monsters created depend on the condition of the remains. A reasonably intact corpse may only arise as a zombie, while similarly intact skeletal remains may only be animated as a skeleton. The caster chooses which remains are animated when casting the spell, in any case where there are more bodies than the caster can animate.\nNo character may normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times their level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast."

Objects to be animated may not be in the possession (worn or carried) of any creature, and must be non-magical in nature. The caster can animate one object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level (i.e. 300 lbs. at 12th level, 325 lbs. at 13th level, and so on).\nSuch objects are normally used to attack the enemies of the caster, and the GM must rule on their effectiveness in combat. In general, animated objects attack using the same attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM’s discretion). As a special case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated objects have a movement rate of 10’, and generally must move in contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the GM)."

Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded creature’s attack rolls if the saving throw fails.\nThe reversed spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind in the same way as continual light."

The caster must have some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described to the caster. Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a name) is enough for this spell to function.\nThis spell works as well indoors or even underground as it does in the outdoors. However, find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. It can only lead someone to a destination that is on the same plane of existence as the caster when cast; this can be very limiting if the caster (and subject if any) is in a closed or pocket universe of some kind.\nThe subject can sense the approximate direction of the destination, but also knows the best path to get there, sensing each turning and knowing which paths or corridors to follow when choices appear (but not sooner, unfortunately). The spell even overcomes things such as secret doors, which the subject will sense and know how to open, and grants the knowledge of passwords or codes at the correct moments.\nNote that the spell will always choose the best path. For example, if the shortest way requires the use of a key which the subject does not have, the spell will choose a different, probably longer way if possible. If this is not possible, the subject will be led to the locked door and will understand that they must find a way to pass through on their own.\nThe spell ends when the subject arrives at the destination or when the duration expires, whichever comes first.

Those within the area of the flames suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level, with a saving throw vs. Spells allowed for half damage.\nNo roll is normally required when casting this spell, but if the caster wishes to project the ember through a slit or other small opening they must roll a missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit it; failure indicates the fireball hits an adjacent surface and detonates there.\nCombustible objects or substances within the area of effect will generally catch fire and possibly be destroyed (as determined by the GM). Metals with low melting points such as gold, silver, lead, copper, or bronze may be softened briefly and thus deformed, but the flames do not persist long enough to actually melt the metal items unless they are very small (such as a thin gold neck chain for example).\nWhile the fireball exerts little if any force or pressure when exploding, it may still destroy weak or flammable barriers; if such a thing happens (in the determination of the GM, of course), the fireball completes its expansion in the space beyond the destroyed barrier."

A party of invisible characters will likely experience problems with running into or tripping over each other. The spell lasts at most 24 hours if not ended sooner. It ends instantly if the target attacks an opponent or casts any spell. Other actions do not normally end the spell.

Likewise, if the target is an object being held by an unwilling creature, a similar attack roll and saving throw will be required. Unattended objects are automatically affected when touched.\nThe caster controls the levitating subject mentally. If the caster ceases to control the subject, it remains at its current altitude until the spell ends, at which point it falls.\nLevitation does not provide any means of horizontal movement, but neither is the levitated subject fixed in place. It can be moved by pushing or by towing with a rope, for example. A creature being levitated can pull itself along a cliff face or across a ceiling, or pull itself with a rope fixed to a solid object. Movement of this sort is usually at half normal walking speed. The subject cannot, however, change its own altitude.\nIf a levitating creature attempts to attack with most weapons it will find that it is unstable. The first such attack is made at a penalty of -1 on the attack roll, and this penalty worsens by an additional -1 each round to a maximum penalty of -5. Should the creature refrain from making an attack for a full round, it is reduced to the -1 penalty level on the next round. This does not usually affect spellcasting while levitated, however."

The lightning bolt passes through an area 5 feet wide, arcing and jumping, so that while it is not actually 5 feet wide, for game purposes it is treated as if it were.\nThose within the area of the lightning bolt suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level, with a saving throw vs. Spells allowed for half damage.\nIf a lightning bolt is targeted at a body of water it explodes at the point of impact, as described above, but within the water volume struck it expands like a fireball to a maximum radius of 20 feet instead of performing as it does in the air. If a lightning bolt is cast underwater it explodes in the same way, but at the tip of the caster’s outstretched finger.\nThe lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can damage metals with a low melting point; metals such as gold, silver, lead, copper, or bronze may be softened briefly and thus deformed, but the lightning does not persist long enough to actually melt the metal items unless they are very small (such as a thin gold neck chain for example).\nIf the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the GM’s option. Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt."

    "text": "Magic Jar\nRange: 60’\nMagic User 5\nDuration: special\nThis spell allows the caster to attempt to possess the body of another living creature. The caster begins by placing their spirit into a gem, jewel, or large crystal of some sort within the spell range, called the magic jar. The caster needs to know where the magic jar is located, but does not have to be able to see it. While the caster’s spirit is outside their body, that body appears to all intents and purposes to be dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body would.\nEach round after entering the magic jar the caster’s spirit can attempt to take control of the body of a living creature within the spell range; the target is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist. If the saving throw fails, the spirit of the target (now called the host) is trapped in the magic jar and the caster’s spirit takes possession of the host’s body. Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward.\nIf the attempt to possess a victim fails, the caster’s spirit remains in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell. The caster may make an attempt to possess another target on the following round, if desired.\nIf on the other hand the possession attempt is successful, the caster may remain in control of the host’s body for as long as desired. The caster’s spirit may return to the magic jar at any time when it is within spell range, restoring the host’s spirit to its own body. The caster may not return to the same host’s body again for the remainder of the duration of this spell, but may attempt to possess it again on a subsequent casting.\nWhenever the caster’s spirit is in the magic jar, it may choose to return to its own body if it is within spell range. If the body is not in range, the caster’s spirit may become trapped if no vulnerable creatures are in range.\nWhenever the caster’s spirit returns to their own body, the spell ends. There is a 50% chance that the magic jar will shatter when the spell ends (if the spell did not end because it was broken), becoming worthless and unusable.\nWhen the caster’s spirit possesses a host, the caster has access to the physical abilities of the host’s body, including Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, while still retaining their own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The caster has access only to their own knowledge, class and level, attack bonus, saving throws, spell casting ability, and any other purely mental capabilities.\nThe caster does not gain access to supernatural or otherwise extraordinary powers of the host, and may not be able to perform physical actions that the caster has never done before (such as flying, if a winged body has been possessed). The caster does have access to the host’s sensory capabilities, such as Darkvision, the enhanced sense of smell of a dog, and so on\nIf the caster’s spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by dispel magic or physical damage), the caster’s spirit will return to its own body if it is in spell range; if not, the caster’s spirit departs (i.e. the caster dies). In either case, the spell ends.\nIf the caster’s spirit is driven from the host body by dispel evil, and the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit returns to the jar and the host’s spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit is freed from the jar and also departs, and the host’s body dies.\nIf the host’s spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken while in spell range of the host body, the caster’s spirit departs, the host’s spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. If the jar is broken while out of range of the host’s body, the host’s spirit departs, the caster’s spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel evil can still be used to drive the caster’s spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell. A stranded caster may use another casting of this spell (with another magic jar, of course) to return to their own body, which of course kills the host’s body."

The enchantment can remain in place indefinitely, but is expended when triggered (i.e. the message is normally delivered only once).\nThe message recounted may be up to three words per caster level in length. The caster may insert pauses in the message, but the entire message must be delivered in a time period of no more than a turn. The voice of the spell can be made to speak at any volume attainable by a normal human. It will sound enough like the caster’s own voice to be recognized by a close associate of the caster, but not identical.\nThe illusionary mouth moves as if actually speaking the message being delivered, and remains visible during pauses. If placed on an artistic depiction of a creature with a mouth (such as a painting or statue), the spell can be made to appear to animate the mouth of the object.\nThis spell cannot be used to activate magic items which have command words, nor to activate any other magical effects.\nThe caster must choose the conditions under which this spell is triggered. The conditions may be as complicated or simple as desired, but must depend only on sight and hearing; the spell has no other sensory capabilities. The spell also has no particular intelligence, and can be fooled by disguises or illusions. The spell does have the capability to effectively see in normal darkness, but not in any sort of magical darkness, and it cannot detect invisible creatures nor see through doors, walls, or even opaque curtains. Likewise, stealth or magical silence are effective in preventing audible triggers. Finally, the spell cannot detect a character’s class, level, ability scores, or any other feature not obvious to a normal NPC.\nTriggers have an effective sensory range of 10 feet per caster level; sounds, sights, or actions outside that range will never trigger the spell."

Unlike polymorph self, the transformed target also gains the behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special, supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such. If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target may not remember its former life.\nThe target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, as noted above. A creature with shape changing abilities such as a doppleganger can revert to its natural form after one round.\nEquipment worn or carried will be dropped if the new form is unable to wear or carry the items. If any such items would be constricting or physically harmful to the new form, the transformation slows and alters such that they are dropped without damage to the items nor harm to the target creature. If the GM determines that any items cannot be removed in this way, they must decide on the exact results.\nUnwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are not affected.

A magical barrier with a radius of just 1 foot is created around the subject. The barrier moves with the subject, and provides three specific forms of magical protection against attacks or other effects attempted by the affected creatures against the subject.\nFirst, the subject receives a bonus of +2 to their Armor Class, and a similar bonus of +2 on all saving throws. Second, the barrier blocks all attempts to charm or otherwise control the subject, or to possess the subject (such as with magic jar). Such attempts simply fail during the duration of this spell. Note however that a creature who receives this protection after being possessed is not cured of the possession.\nThird, any and all summoned creatures and extraplanar creatures of evil nature are unable to physically touch the subject. Attacks by such creatures using their natural weapons simply fail. This effect is canceled if the subject performs any form of physical attack (even with a ranged weapon) on any affected creature, but the other features of the spell continue in force.\nReversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are kept away, rather than “evil” ones."

The target creature must be able to hear and understand the caster, or it cannot be affected. This spell will automatically fail if used to compel a creature to engage in some obviously self-destructive action.\nA saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service. Once subjected to this spell, the subject must obey the instructions given by the caster indefinitely, though if the quest is to perform some action the spell effectively ends when that action has been completed.\nFor every 24 hours that an affected creature chooses not to obey the quest (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers 3d6 points of damage. This damage is limited, in that it will not kill the target; if the damage is enough to do so, roll 1d4 for the number of hit points the affected creature retains (similar to the spell harm, the reverse of heal).\nIf the task assigned to the subject of this spell is open- ended or otherwise unable to be completed, the subject is still compelled to try to perform the task, but the spell will end in no more than one day per caster level.\nVery clever creatures may be able to subvert the instructions given; the GM must decide on the results of any such attempts.\nA quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell.

The caster can only raise a being that has not been dead for more days than the caster has levels. The spirit of the target of this spell must be willing to return. If the target’s spirit is trapped or contained in any way, the spell will fail. It will also fail if the target died of old age, as the body simply has no life left in it. Similarly, undead creatures are not affected by this spell as they can no longer be returned to life in any normal sense.\nThe body of the target must be adequately intact to support life, but all wounds no matter how major are healed. Body parts missing when the target is raised are still missing afterward. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone.\nCreatures brought back from the dead always suffer some loss or penalty from the ordeal. Characters lose one level of ability permanently (i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience points required for the previous level). First level characters are reduced to Normal Man status; if the character was already a Normal Man they lose a point of Constitution. These losses are permanent, though of course the character may gain levels in the normal fashion. (Characters reduced to Normal Man status must gain 1,000 XP to return to 1st level).\nMonstrous humanoids (orcs, goblins, and the like) lose one hit die, or are reduced to ½ hit dice if the monster has just one to start with. Such humanoids who already have ½ hit dice are reduced to a single hit point. These losses are generally permanent, though the GM may allow such creatures in service to a player character to recover by gaining 1,000 XP per hit die the creature would be returning to (so a lizard man who has been reduced to 1 hit die must earn 2,000 XP to return to its original 2 hit dice); treat such a creature as being a retainer for this purpose.\nUpon being raised, the target has 1 hit point per level or hit die (using its current reduced figure, of course), with a minimum of 1 hit point. A character who died with spells prepared has none prepared upon being raised.\nThe reverse of this spell, slay living, will kill instantly the creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If the saving throw is successful, 2d6 points of damage is dealt to the victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell in combat."

The new form is a young adult, unless the target was younger than that when they died, in which case the new body is the same age as the deceased body.\nThe target creature’s new body has obviously suffered none of the harm that may have befallen the old one, and is completely healthy (at least, to start with).\nThe target remembers their previous life, and retains the same class (if possible for the new form) as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character’s ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.) The target loses one level (or hit die); this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. The target’s hit points should be rerolled completely, as this is an entirely new body. If the target was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction its new Constitution score is reduced by 2\nCharacters turned into non-character humanoids (such as an elf who returns as a kobold) will require adjudication by the GM; if the restored target is a player character, the GM is counseled to give as much leeway to the player as possible with the character’s new form. Conversely, non-character humanoids who return as characters will need all ability scores rolled; such characters will usually be fighters with a level equal to the target’s previous hit dice minus 1, or as Normal Men if the target’s previous hit dice were 1 or less.\nUndead creatures are not affected by this spell; such creatures can no longer be returned to life in any normal sense."

The corpse will answer at most one question per two caster levels, but if the duration expires any remaining questions are lost. The corpse only knows what it knew when it was alive; this includes the languages it knew in life. Thus, the caster must share a language with the deceased in order to get any questions answered at all.\nThe answers given are drawn from knowledge “imprinted” on the corpse during life; the caster does not in any case actually communicate with the spirit of the deceased creature. The corpse cannot retain any information given to it, and does not even remember any previous instances of communication via this spell.\nThe answers given may not be useful for various reasons. If the corpse knew the caster when it was alive, or if the caster is a member of a group the deceased disliked, it may choose to lie or mislead the caster. If the caster asks the corpse questions of a personal nature, or questions that indicate the caster may be working against whatever interests the corpse had in life, it will almost certainly seek to mislead the caster.\nIf the corpse has been roused by this spell within the last seven days, the spell will fail. Undead creatures (including the remains of defeated undead creatures) cannot be affected by this spell."

The spell transports the caster only within their current plane of existence. Other creatures (passengers) and inanimate objects (cargo) may be transported along with the caster, up to a maximum of 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature’s possession from being teleported.\nThe spell is directed by the mind of the caster, who must visualize the destination area; failure to visualize it properly can cause the spell to fail in a variety of ways, and destinations heavily saturated with magical energy (as defined by the Game Master) will cause the spell to fail automatically.\nTo determine the results of this spell, roll d% and consult the table below.

Any place where the caster lived for more than a month in the last ten years, or more than a year in their life, also qualifies.\nKnows Somewhat applies when the caster has spent substantial time in the destination area, but not enough to qualify for Knows Well. Alternately, the caster may have made an in-depth study of the area, looking at accurate drawings, maps, and floorplans or spending hours listening to descriptions from one or more people who Know Well the destination.\nSaw Once applies when the caster has visited a place for as much as a day, but no more, or when the caster has attempted the study required for the second definition of Knows Somewhat but has failed to acquire enough information (in the GM’s opinion).\nIf the caster attempts to travel to a location that does not exist, or perhaps once existed but has been destroyed or otherwise changed so much that the caster would not recognize it, roll 2d20 instead d% for the result of the casting. In this case, if Success! is rolled the spell simply fails and no one is transported anywhere.\nSuccess! means exactly what it says. The caster, passengers, and cargo arrive safely exactly where the caster intended\nFell Short indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive safely 1d8x10% of the way to the intended destination. Note that arriving “safely” does not mean that the destination is safe, but only the trip\nWrong Place means that the caster, passengers, and cargo arrive at some place that resembles the intended destination. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range, as decided by the GM. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.\nDisaster indicates that the caster, passengers, and cargo have encountered dimensional turbulence and have crashed, becoming separated (if passengers and/or cargo accompanied the caster) and being injured in the process. Each creature including the caster suffers 1d12 points of damage, and then rolls again on the same column using 2d20 instead of d%. If another Disaster is rolled for any creature, apply another 1d12 points of damage and roll once more. Cargo objects are not normally damaged but the result must be rolled for each such item to determine where it has appeared; in this case, if Disaster is rolled the cargo item disappears forever."

The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if desired. The wall may be up to 20’ tall (as desired by the caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).

Damage is applied on the round the spell is cast and each round thereafter.

The wall stands upright, and consists of up to one 10’x10’ square section, one inch thick, per caster level. The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller than the maximum size if desired. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick, and must always be created in contact with the ground or floor beneath it. It is always a flat plate with no bends, but the edges do not have to be straight; indeed, the caster can cause the wall edge to mold itself around any obstructing object very closely. The wall cannot otherwise be created such that it occupies the space of any object or creature.\nIf the caster wishes, the wall edges will bond to any inanimate materials they touch (stone walls, soil, furnishings, and so on). If this is not done, the wall may be unsupported (as determined by the GM based on the situation) and will thus likely fall. If left unattended, there is an equal chance it will fall in either direction in 1d6 rounds, but it can be pushed in a specific direction by any character having a minimum of Strength score of 13, or any monster with 4 or more hit dice. Several creatures can work together to do so if desired. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.)\nWhen the wall falls, any creatures it falls upon are likely to be injured or killed. If it is possible for a character or creature to escape the area (i.e. it has sufficient movement rate and is not otherwise prevented from doing so), it is allowed to roll a save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). If this save is successful, the creature or character moves by the most direct route to the nearest safe space; if the save fails or it is for some reason impossible to flee, 10d6 points of damage are inflicted on that victim. Creatures larger than ogre-sized are immune to being crushed and will simply be knocked down if the save fails.\nThe wall is permanent, as indicated, but being made of iron is susceptible to rust and corrosion"

The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halves the area. The wall cannot be created such that it occupies the space of any object or creature. It must be adequately supported by existing stone, which it will bond with automatically, but need not be supported over its entire area. For example, a wall of stone may be formed into a bridge over a stream or chasm, so long as both ends of the bridge rest solidly upon (and bond with) existing stone.\nBridges longer than 20 feet must be arched, buttressed, or both in order to stand; this extra construction reduces the wall’s usable volume by half, as does creating a wall with battlements, crenelations, and similar basic structural elements. No complex structural elements may be created by this spell.\nThough made by magic, the wall is made of stone and can be broken or damaged just as if it were ordinary stone.\nThe wall can be formed into a container to trap creatures, and if this is attempted the targets of the spell are allowed to save vs. Death Ray to avoid being trapped. If the save is successful the targets are able to make up to one full move to a space outside the container."

The webs must be attached to adjacent solid objects such as walls, pillars, and the like; any unsupported section of webbing collapses to the ground and disappears. Within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs they wish, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if they wish.\nCreatures within the web at the time the spell is cast, as well as anyone entering the area afterward, will become entangled. Each should roll a save vs. Death Ray, and any creatures who succeed at this save may move through the webbing but are reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again.\nThose who fail the save are fully entangled and trapped. They cannot move, cast spells, or perform normal attacks or any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.\nAttacks against an entangled creature by one outside the webbing will not normally entrap the attacker, so long as they do not need to venture into the web to reach the entangled target.\nThe web can be ignited; any application of fire to the webbing will cause a 10 foot cube to burn away in one round, with all 10 foot cubes adjacent to the destroyed one burning in the next round, and so on. If any part of the web becomes unsupported it will collapse and disappear as noted above.\nCreatures trapped within the burning web suffer 2d4 points of damage when the cube they are trapped in burns, but they are thereafter completely free of the web."

    "text": "Time and Scale\nTime in the dungeon is measured in game turns, which are (approximately) 10 minutes long. When combat begins, the time scale changes to combat rounds, which are (approximately) 10 seconds long. Thus, there are 60 combat rounds per game turn.\nDistances in the dungeon are measured in feet. Outdoors, change all distance measurements (movement, range, etc.) to yards (so 100’ becomes 100 yards) but area of effect measurements (for spells, for instance) normally remain in feet.\n\n\nCarrying Capacity\nNormal Human, Elven and Dwarvish player characters are able to carry up to 60 pounds and still be considered lightly loaded, or up to 150 pounds and be considered heavily loaded. Halflings may carry up to 50 pounds and be considered lightly loaded, or up to 100 pounds and be heavily loaded. Note that armor for Halfling characters is about one-quarter as heavy as armor for the other races.\nThese figures are affected by Strength; each +1 of Strength bonus adds 10% to the capacity of the character, while each -1 deducts 20%. Thus, carrying capacities for normal characters are as shown below (rounded to the nearest 5 pounds for convenience):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDwarf, Elf, Human\nHalfling\n\n\nStrength\nLight Load\nHeavy Load\nLight Load\nHeavy Load\n\n\n\n\n3\n25\n60\n20\n40\n\n\n4-5\n35\n90\n30\n60\n\n\n6-8\n50\n120\n40\n80\n\n\n9-12\n60\n150\n50\n100\n\n\n13-15\n65\n165\n55\n110\n\n\n16-17\n70\n180\n60\n120\n\n\n18\n80\n195\n65\n130\n\n\n\nThe carrying capacities of various domesticated animals are given in the Monsters section.\n\n\nMovement and Encumbrance\nThe movement rate of a character or creature is expressed as the number of feet it can move per combat round. The normal player character races can all move 40’ per round. When exploring a dungeon, time is expressed in turns, as explained above; normal movement per turn is 3 times the movement rate per round.\nThis may seem slow, but this rate of movement includes such things as drawing maps, watching out for traps and monsters (though they may still surprise the party), etc. In a combat situation, on the other hand, everyone is moving around swiftly, and such things as drawing maps are not important.\nA character’s movement rate is adjusted by his or her Encumbrance (the load he or she is carrying) as follows:\n\n\n\nArmor Type\nLightly Loaded\nHeavily Loaded\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Armor or Magic Leather\n40’\n30’\n\n\n\nLeather Armor or Magic Metal\n30’\n20’\n\n\n\nMetal Armor\n20’\n10’\n\n\n\n\nCount the weight of armor worn when calculating encumbrance, because armor counts both for bulk and restrictiveness as well as for weight. Magic armor counts for its full weight but is not as bulky and restrictive as normal armor, thus granting an improved movement rate.\n\n\nMapping\nIn any dungeon expedition, making maps is important. Generally one player will do this, drawing a map on graph paper as the Game Master describes each room or corridor. Absolute accuracy is usually not possible; the main thing is to ensure that the party can find its way back out of the dungeon.\n\n\nLight\nA torch or lantern will provide light covering a 30’ radius; dim light will extend about 20’ further. Normal torches burn for 1d4+4 turns, while a flask of oil in a lantern will burn for 18+1d6 turns. A candle will shed light over a 5’ radius, with dim light extending 5’ further. In general, taper candles such as are used for illumination will burn about 3 turns per inch of height.\n\nimport {rolld4,rolld6} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nviewof torch = Inputs.input(0)\n\nhtl.html`&lt;div style=\"display:grid; grid-template-columns: 50% auto; vertical-align:midle\"&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n${Inputs.bind(Inputs.button(\"Torch Turns (1d4+4)\", {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; (4 + rolld4() )}), viewof torch)}\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\nTorch burn turns = ${torch.value}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof oil = Inputs.input(0)\n\nhtl.html`&lt;div style=\"display:grid; grid-template-columns: 50% auto; vertical-align:midle\"&gt;\n${Inputs.bind(Inputs.button(\"Oil Lantern (1d6 + 18)\", {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; (18 + rolld6() )}), viewof oil)}\nLantern Turns = ${oil.value}\n&lt;/div&gt;\n`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkvision\nSome character races, and almost all monsters, have Darkvision. This gives them the ability to see even in total darkness. Darkvision is black and white only but otherwise like normal sight. Darkvision does not grant one the ability to see in magical darkness. The range of Darkvision is typically either 30’ or 60’; if not given for a particular creature, assume the 60’ range.\nDarkvision is totally ineffective in any light greater than moonlight.\n\n\nDoors\nA stuck door can be opened on a roll of 1 on 1d6; add the character’s Strength bonus to the range, so that a character with a bonus of +2 can open a stuck door on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6.\nLocked doors can be forced by rolling the same range, but on 1d10. Metal bars can sometimes be bent on a roll of this range on 1d20.\nA careful character might choose to listen at a door before opening it. Thieves have a special ability, Listen, which should be applied if the listener is a Thief. For other characters, the GM rolls 1d6, with 1 indicating success. Sounds heard might include voices, footsteps, or any other sound the GM considers appropriate. Of course, the room beyond the door might really be silent; thus, the Game Master must make the roll, so that a roll of 1 in such a case will not give anything away to the players.\n\nimport {generalDice} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nviewof i = Inputs.input(0)\nviewof j = Inputs.input(0)\nviewof k = Inputs.input(0)\n\n\nviewof form = Inputs.form(\n  {\n    doors: Inputs.bind(Inputs.button(\" 1d6 \", {value: 1, reduce: () =&gt; (rolld6() )}), viewof i),\n    forceBars: Inputs.bind(Inputs.button(\" Force Bar \", {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; (generalDice(1,20,0) )}), viewof j),\n    forceDoor: Inputs.bind(Inputs.button(\" Force Door \", {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; (generalDice(1,10,0) )}), viewof k),\n  },\n  {\n    template: (formParts) =&gt; htl.html`\n     &lt;div&gt;\n       &lt;div style=\"\n         display: grid;\n         grid-template-columns: 50% auto; \n         vertical-align:midle;\n         row-gap: 10px;\n       \"&gt;\n         ${Object.values(formParts)[0]} 1d6 result: ${i.value}\n         ${Object.values(formParts)[1]} Force Bar: ${j.value}\n         ${Object.values(formParts)[2]} Force Door: ${k.value}\n\n       &lt;/div&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;`\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraps\nDungeons and ruins frequently contain traps, including spear-throwers, covered pits, etc. The GM will decide what is required to trigger a trap, and what happens when the trap is triggered. (Some guidance on this is provided in the Game Master section later in this book.) In general, there will be some way to avoid or reduce the effect of the trap being sprung. For instance, a save vs. Death Ray is often used to avoid falling into a covered pit (with Dexterity bonus added), while spear-throwers, automated crossbows, and the like are sometimes treated as if they were monsters (attacking vs. the victim’s Armor Class at some given attack bonus).\nNormal characters have a chance equal to a roll of 1 on 1d6 to detect a trap if a search for one is made. Note that this is about a 16.7% chance; Thieves have a special ability to find and remove traps, which supersedes this roll, as does the stonework trap-finding ability of Dwarves. A Dwarven Thief is a special case; apply whichever trap-detection ability is higher. In all cases, a search for traps takes at least a turn per 10’ square area. A single character may only effectively search a given area for traps once, even if the character has more than one trap-detection roll “type” allowed (such as the Dwarven Thief above).\nTrap detection may not be allowed if the trap is purely magical in nature; on the other hand, in such cases Magic-Users and/or Clerics may be able to detect magical traps at the given 1 in 1d6 chance, at the Game Master’s option.\n\n\nSecret Doors\nUnder normal conditions, searching for secret doors takes one turn per character per 10’ of wall searched. A secret door is found on a roll of 1 on 1d6; characters with 15 or higher Intelligence succeed on a roll of 1-2. Also, as noted previously, Elves add 1 to the range automatically, such that an Elf discovers secret doors on a 1-2 on 1d6, or 1-3 if the Elf has an Intelligence of 15 or higher. The GM may create secret doors that are more difficult (or easier) to detect at his or her option.\nMultiple characters searching for secret doors ensures that any such will eventually be found; however, if the first and second searchers fail, the next searcher must take two turns to search, and all subsequent searches of the area require an hour.\nNote that finding a secret door does not grant understanding of how it works. The GM may require additional rolls or other actions to be taken before the door can be opened.\n\n\nDungeon Survival\nAs described in the Equipment section, normal characters must consume one day’s worth of rations (or equivalent food) and at least one quart of water per day.\nFailure to consume enough food does not significantly affect a character for the first two days, after which he or she loses 1 hit point per day. Furthermore, at that point the character loses the ability to heal wounds normally, though magic will still work. Eating enough food for a day (over the course of about a day, not all at once) restores the ability to heal, and the character will recover lost hit points at the normal rate.\nInadequate water affects characters more swiftly; after a single day without adequate water, the character loses 1d4 hit points, and will lose an additional 1d4 hit points per day thereafter; healing ability is lost when the first die of damage is rolled."

    "text": "Wilderness Movement Rates\nMovement rates when traveling in the wilderness are related directly to encounter movement rates, as shown on the table below:\n\n\n\nEncounter Movement (Ft per Rnd)\nWilderness Movement (Mls per Day)\n\n\n\n\n10’\n6\n\n\n20’\n12\n\n\n30’\n18\n\n\n40’\n24\n\n\n50’\n30\n\n\n60’\n36\n\n\n70’\n42\n\n\n80’\n48\n\n\n90’\n54\n\n\n100’\n60\n\n\n110’\n66\n\n\n120’\n72\n\n\n\nNaturally, any group traveling together moves at the rate of the slowest member.\n\n\nOverland Travel\nThe movement rates shown on the table above are figured based on an 8 hour day of travel through open, clear terrain. The terrain type will alter the rate somewhat, as shown on this table:\n\n\n\nTerrain\nAdjustment\n\n\n\n\nJungle, Mountains, Swamp\n×1/3\n\n\nDesert, Forest, Hills\n×2/3\n\n\nClear, Plains, Trail\n×1\n\n\nRoad (Paved)\n×1 1/3\n\n\n\nCharacters may choose to perform a forced march, traveling 12 hours per day. If this is done, add an additional 50% to the distance traveled. Each day of forced march performed after the first inflicts 1d6 damage on the characters (and their animals, if any). A save vs. Death Ray with Constitution bonus applied is allowed to avoid this damage, but after this save is failed once, it is not rolled again for that character or creature. A day spent resting “restarts” the progression.\n\n\nBecoming Lost\nThough adventurers following roads, rivers, or other obvious landmarks are unlikely to become lost, striking out into trackless forest, windblown desert, and so on is another matter. Secretly roll a save vs. Death Ray, adjusted by the Wisdom of the party leader (i.e., whichever character seems to be leading). An Ability Roll against Wisdom may be rolled, if that optional rule is in use. The GM must determine the effects of failure\n\n\nWaterborne Travel\nTravel by water may be done in a variety of boats or ships; see the table in the Vehicles section for details. Travel distances are based on a 12 hour day of travel, rather than the usual 8 hours per day given above. Note that sailed ships may travel 24 hours per day (if a qualified navigator is aboard), and so may be able to cover twice the normal distance per day of travel. This is in addition to the multiplier given below. If the ship stops each night, as is done by some vessels traveling along a coastline as well as those vessels having less than the minimum number of regular crewmen on board, the two-times multiplier does not apply.\nMovement of sailed ships varies depending on weather conditions, as shown on the following table. Sailing movement modifiers shown apply when sailing with the wind; sailing against the wind involves tacking (called “zigzagging” by landlubbers) which reduces movement rates as indicated on the table.\n\nimport {generalTableSelect, highlightTableRow} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nInputs.button(\"Roll on Table\", {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRow(\"#wind-direction\", generalTableSelect([1,12,0],[[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5],[6,6],[7,7],[8,8],[9,12]]))})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd12\nWind Direction\n\n\n\n\n1\nNortherly\n\n\n2\nNortheasterly\n\n\n3\nEasterly\n\n\n4\nSoutheasterly\n\n\n5\nSoutherly\n\n\n6\nSouthwesterly\n\n\n7\nWesterly\n\n\n8\nNorthwesterly\n\n\n9-12\nPrevailing wind direction for this locale\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs.button(\"Roll on Table\", {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRow(\"#wind-condition\", generalTableSelect([1,100,0],[[1,5],[6,13],[14,25],[26,40],[41,70],[71,85],[86,96],[97,100]]))})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd%\nWind Conditions\nSailing\nTacking\n\n\n\n\n01-05\nBecalmed\nx0\nx0\n\n\n06-13\nVery Light Breeze\nx1/3\nx0\n\n\n14-25\nLight Breeze\nx1/2\nx1/3\n\n\n26-40\nModerate Breeze\nx2/3\nx1/3\n\n\n41-70\nAverage Winds\nx1\nx1/2\n\n\n71-85\nStrong Winds\nx1 1/3\nx2/3\n\n\n86-96\nVery Strong Winds\nx1 1/2\nx0\n\n\n97-00\nGale\nx2\nx0\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\nBecalmed: Sailing ships cannot move.

Most winged creatures must maintain at least one-third normal forward movement in order to remain airborne; however, devices such as flying carpets generally do not have this limitation."

    "title": "12  Hirelings",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Player characters will sometimes want or need to hire NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to work for them. There are several categories of NPCs available for hire, as follows:\n\nRetainers\nA retainer is a close associate of his employer. Retainers are hired for a share of treasure (typically at least 15% of the employer’s income) plus support costs (weapons, armor, rations, and basic equipment provided by the employer). Retainers are typically very loyal and are willing to take reasonable risks; in particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will generally accompany a player character into a dungeon, lair, or ruin.\nHiring a retainer is more involved than hiring other NPCs. First, the player character must advertise for a retainer, typically by hiring a crier, posting notices in public places, or asking (and possibly paying) NPCs such as innkeepers or taverners to direct potential retainers to the player character. It is up to the Game Master to rule on what must be done, and how successful these activities are.\nIf the player character is successful, one or more NPCs will present themselves to be interviewed. The Game Master should play out the interview with the player, and after all offers have been made and all questions asked, a reaction roll should be made. To check the potential retainer’s reaction, the Game Master rolls 2d6 and adds the player character’s Charisma bonus. In addition, the Game Master may apply any adjustments he or she feels are appropriate (a bonus of +1 for higher-than-average pay or the offer of a magic item such as a sword +1, or a penalty if the player character offers poor terms). The roll is read as follows:\n\nimport {generalTableSelect2, highlightTableRowRet} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nviewof reaction = Inputs.button(\"Roll on Table\", {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRowRet(\"#reaction-roll\", generalTableSelect2([2,6,0],[[2,2],[3,5],[6,8],[9,11],[12,12]]))})\nmd`2d6: ${reaction}`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Die Roll\nResult\n\n\n\n\n2 or less\nRefusal, -1 on further rolls\n\n\n3-5\nRefusal\n\n\n6-8\nTry again\n\n\n9-11\nAcceptance\n\n\n12 or more\nAcceptance, +1 to Loyalty\n\n\n\n\nRefusal, -1 on further rolls means that all further reaction rolls made toward that player character in the given town or region will be at a penalty of -1 due to unkind words said by the NPC to his fellows. If the player character tries again in a different town, the penalty does not apply.\nIf a Try again result is rolled, the potential retainer is reluctant, and needs more convincing; the player character must “sweeten” the deal in order to get an additional roll, such as by offering more pay, a magic item, etc. If the player character makes no better offer, treat Try again as a Refusal result.\nLoyalty: All retainers have a Loyalty score, which is generally 7 plus the employer’s Charisma bonus (or penalty). The Loyalty score is used just as the Morale score of monsters or mercenaries is used.\nIf a Loyalty check roll made in combat is a natural 2, the Loyalty of the retainer increases by +1 point. Note that a Loyalty of 12 is fanatical… the retainer will do virtually anything the player character asks, and never flee in combat. However, the Game Master should still apply penalties when the player character instructs the retainer to do something which appears very risky, making a failed check possible.\nIn addition, the Game Master should roll a Loyalty check for each retainer at the end of each adventure, after treasure is divided, to determine if the retainer will remain with the player character. The GM may apply adjustments to this roll, probably no more than two points plus or minus, if the retainer is particularly well or poorly paid.\nMaximum Number of Retainers: A player character may hire at most 4 retainers, adjusted by the character’s Charisma bonus or penalty. Any attempts to hire more than this number of retainers will be met with automatic refusals.\nLevel of Retainers: Normally, potential retainers will be one-half the level of the employer (or less). So, a first level character cannot hire retainers, second level PCs can only hire first level characters, and so on. Of course, there is no way for the retainers to directly know the level of the PC employer, nor for the employer to know the level of the potential retainer; but the Game Master should usually enforce this rule for purposes of game balance. It shouldn’t be surprising that first level characters can’t hire retainers, as they have no reputation to speak of yet.\nExperience for Retainers: Unlike other hired NPCs, retainers do gain experience just as other adventurers do; however, as they are under the command of a player character, only one-half of a share of XP is allocated to each retainer. See Character Advancement.\n\n\nSpecialists\nSpecialists are NPCs who may be hired by player characters to perform various tasks. Specialists do not go on adventures or otherwise risk their lives fighting monsters, disarming traps, or any of the other dangerous things player characters and retainers may do. Rather, specialists perform services the player characters usually can’t perform for themselves, like designing and erecting castles, training animals, or operating ships.\nA player character is limited in the number of specialists he or she can hire only by the amount of money they cost; Charisma does not affect this.\nAlchemist: 1,000 gp per month.These characters are generally hired for one of two reasons: to make potions, or to assist a Magic-User with magical research.\nAn alchemist can produce a potion, given the required materials and a sample or a written formula for the potion, in the same time and for the same cost as a Magic-User. They may also research new potions, but at twice the cost in time and materials as a Magic-User. Review the rules for Magical Research for details.\nAlternately, a Magic-User seeking to create certain magic items may employ an alchemist as an assistant. In this case, the alchemist adds 15% to the Magic-User’s chance of success.\nAnimal Trainer: 250 to 750 gp per month. Characters wishing to ride hippogriffs or employ carnivorous apes as guards will need the assistance of an animal trainer. The lowest cost above is for an average animal trainer, able to train one type of “normal” animal such as carnivorous apes; those able to train more than one sort of animal, or to train monstrous creatures such as hippogriffs, are more expensive to hire. The Game Master must decide how long it takes to train an animal; in some cases, animal training may take years, a fact the player characters may find inconvenient as well as expensive. A single animal trainer can train and manage no more than 5 animals at a time, though in most cases once an animal is fully trained, if it is put into service right away the animal trainer won’t be needed to handle it any longer.\nArmorer (or Weaponsmith): 100 to 500 gp per month. Characters hiring mercenaries, or having armed and armored followers to take care of, will need the services of an armorer. In general, for every 50 Fighters employed, one armorer is required to care for their gear. The armorer’s equipment is not included in the costs given above, but the cost to maintain his apprentices is included; most such characters will have 1d4 apprentices assisting.\nHigher priced armorers or weaponsmiths may be hired to assist in making magic weapons or armor; in this case, the character hired will be a specialist, an expert in making one particular type of armor or weapon, and will command a higher price (as shown above). Such characters will rarely agree to do the mundane work of maintaining weapons and armor for a military unit.\nEngineer: 750 gp per month. Any player character wishing to build a fortress, a ship, or any other mundane construction will need an engineer. Large projects may require several engineers, at the GM’s option.\nSavant: 1,500 gp per month. Savants are experts in ancient and obscure knowledge. Many savants have particular interests in very limited or focused areas (for example, “Elven migrations of the 2nd age”), but even these will know or have access to a lot of facts. The listed cost is the minimum required to maintain a savant with his library, collections, etc. If the savant’s patron asks a difficult question, there may be additional costs for materials or research to answer it.\nShip’s Crew: Special. A crew for a waterborne vessel involves several types of characters. At the very least, a complement of sailors and a Captain are needed; rowers will be needed aboard galleys, and a Navigator is required aboard ships going out of sight of land.\nCosts per month for each sort of character are given below:\n\n\n\nSeaman Type\nCost\n\n\n\n\nCaptain\n300 gp\n\n\nNavigator\n200 gp\n\n\nSailor\n10 gp\n\n\nRower\n3 gp\n\n\n\nIn general, all such characters are normal men, and are not armored; they will usually be armed with clubs, daggers, or shortswords. Player characters with appropriate backgrounds may act as Captain, but unless experienced as a ship’s captain, they will have difficulty commanding respect from the regular sailors (lower the Morale of such regular sailors by -2 if led by an inexperienced Captain).\n\n\nMercenaries\nMercenaries are hired warriors. They are generally hired in units as small as platoons: 32 to 48 Fighters, divided into two to four squads of soldiers; each squad is led by a corporal, while the platoon is led by a lieutenant plus a sergeant. Platoons are joined together into companies, each generally consisting of two to five platoons and led by a captain with a sergeant as his assistant (called a first sergeant).\nAs mercenaries are almost always veteran troops, the average mercenary is a 1st level Fighter; 10% of corporals and 50% of sergeants are 2nd level. A mercenary lieutenant will generally be 2nd level, while a captain will be 2nd to 4th level and his first sergeant will be 2nd or 3rd level. Larger mercenary units will usually be beyond the reach of player characters until they have reached fairly high levels, and are left to the Game Master to detail.\nMercenaries will virtually never go into a dungeon, lair, or ruin, at least until it has been fully cleared. Rather, they are used in outdoor military engagements; high level player characters may hire mercenaries to defend or help defend their castles or other holdings.\nMercenaries housed in a player character’s stronghold require 200 square feet each but cost 25% less per month, as this is covered by their room and board. (Elven mercenaries, however, require 500 square feet of space each in order to reduce their pay, as they demand better living conditions.) See the Stronghold section for more details.\nStatistics are given below for the most common sorts of mercenaries; the statistics are for first level characters, and should be adjusted when higher level characters are indicated (as given above). In particular, multiply the given cost of each mercenary by his or her level. Listed costs are in gold pieces per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of Mercenary\nCost\nEquipment\nMorale\n\n\n\n\nLight Foot, Human\n2\nLeather Armor, Shield, and Longsword\n8\n\n\nLight Foot, Elf\n8\nLeather Armor, Shield, and Longsword\n8\n\n\nLight Foot, Orc\n1\nLeather Armor and Spear\n7\n\n\nHeavy Foot, Human\n3\nChainmail, Shield, and Longsword\n8\n\n\nHeavy Foot, Dwarf\n6\nChainmail, Shield, and Shortsword\n9\n\n\nHeavy Foot, Orc\n2\nChainmail, Shield, and Shortsword\n8\n\n\nArcher, Human\n5\nLeather Armor, Shortbow, and Shortsword\n8\n\n\nArcher, Elf\n15\nChainmail, Shortbow, and Shortsword\n8\n\n\nArcher, Orc\n3\nLeather Armor, Shortbow, and Shortsword\n8\n\n\nCrossbowman, Human\n5\nChainmail, Crossbow, and Shortsword\n8\n\n\nCrossbowman, Dwarf\n12\nPlatemail, Crossbow, and Shortsword\n9\n\n\nLongbowman, Human\n9\nChainmail, Longbow, and Shortsword\n8\n\n\nLongbowman, Elf\n20\nChainmail, Longbow, and Longsword\n8\n\n\nLight Horseman, Human\n10\nLeather Armor, Shield, Lance, and Longsword\n8\n\n\nLight Horseman, Elf\n22\nLeather Armor, Lance, Shortbow, and Longsword\n8\n\n\nMedium Horseman, Human\n15\nChainmail, Shield, Lance, and Longsword\n8\n\n\nMedium Horseman, Elf\n33\nChainmail, Lance, Shortbow, and Longsword\n9\n\n\nHeavy Horseman, Human\n20\nPlatemail, Shield, Lance, and Longsword\n8"

    "text": "Experience Points (XP)\nExperience points are given for monsters defeated, and for other challenges as the GM sees fit. The following table provides XP values for monsters. Where a monster has both a character level and hit dice given, use the larger value as the monster’s level. Non-combat challenges may be assigned a level, or a flat XP value assigned, as the GM wishes.\nIf asterisks appear after the hit dice listing for a monster, each asterisk adds the special ability bonus once; for example, a creature with a hit dice figure of 2** is worth 125 XP.\nFor monsters with more than 25 hit dice, add 750 XP to the XP Value and 25 XP to the Special Ability Bonus per additional hit die.\nNPCs should be treated as monsters of a number of hit dice equivalent to the character’s level. Add a special ability bonus for Clerics and Magic-Users if they are able to cast useful spells during the encounter.\nAfter tallying the XP earned in a given adventure, the amount should be divided by the number of adventurers. As described above, each retainer should receive a one-half share; so a group with four player characters and a retainer is counted as having 4½ members. If 2,000 XP are earned by this group, one share is 444 XP, and the retainer receives 222 XP.\nNo character may advance more than one level due to the experience points from a single adventure. For example, Barthal the Thief is 1st level and has 1,000 XP before going on an adventure; during the adventure, he earns 2,000 more XP (an amazing feat). This would make his total 3,000 XP, and he would be a 3rd level Thief. This is not allowed; instead, he advances to 2,499 XP, one short of the amount required for 3rd level, and starts his next adventure at 2nd level.\n\n\n\nTable 13.1: Monster XP values\n\n\nMonster Hit Dice\nXP Value\nSpecial Ability Bonus\n\n\n\n\nless than 1\n10\n3\n\n\n1\n25\n12\n\n\n2\n75\n25\n\n\n3\n145\n30\n\n\n4\n240\n40\n\n\n5\n360\n45\n\n\n6\n500\n55\n\n\n7\n670\n65\n\n\n8\n875\n70\n\n\n9\n1,075\n75\n\n\n10\n1,300\n90\n\n\n11\n1,575\n95\n\n\n12\n1,875\n100\n\n\n13\n2,175\n110\n\n\n14\n2,500\n115\n\n\n15\n2,850\n125\n\n\n16\n3,250\n135\n\n\n17\n3,600\n145\n\n\n18\n4,000\n160\n\n\n19\n4,500\n175\n\n\n20\n5,250\n200\n\n\n21\n6,000\n225\n\n\n22\n6,750\n250\n\n\n23\n7,500\n275\n\n\n24\n8,250\n300\n\n\n25\n9,000\n325"

    "section": "Order of Play",
    "text": "Order of Play\nWhen the party of adventurers comes in contact with potential enemies, time shifts to combat rounds (10 seconds long, as described previously). Before beginning combat, surprise is checked (see below). Unsurprised characters then roll for Initiative, and act in order of the rolls (again, as described below).\n\nSurprise\nWhen surprise is possible, roll 1d6 for each side which might be surprised; most normal characters are surprised on a roll of 1-2. Surprised characters are unable to act for one round. Characters or creatures which are well hidden and prepared to perform an ambush surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. Some characters or creatures (such as Elves) are described as being less likely to be surprised; reduce the range by 1 for such creatures.\nFor example: Darion the Human Fighter and Morningstar the Elven Fighter/Magic-User open a door and come face-to-face with a party of goblins. The GM rolls 1d6 for the goblins; on a 1-2 they are all surprised. Then the GM rolls 1d6 for Darion and Morningstar. If the roll is a 1, both of them are surprised; if the roll is a 2, only Darion is surprised. If the roll is 3 or more, neither of them are surprised.\nSurprised characters or creatures stand flat-footed for one round. They still defend themselves, so there is no penalty to Armor Class, but they cannot move nor attack during the round of surprise.\n\n\nMonster Reactions\nWhen a group of player characters meet one or more monsters, it’s important to know how the monsters will react to the party. In many cases, the reaction of the monster or monsters is obvious… zombies guarding a tomb will virtually always attack intruders, for example.\nIn cases where the reaction of the monsters to the party is not obvious, a reaction roll may be made. The Game Master rolls 2d6, adding the Charisma bonus of the “lead” character (or applying his or her Charisma penalty) along with any other adjustments he or she feels are reasonable, and consults the table below:\n\nimport {generalTableSelect2, highlightTableRowRet} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nviewof mreaction = Inputs.button(\"Roll on Table\", {value: 0, reduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRowRet(\"#monster-reaction\", generalTableSelect2([2,6,0],[[2,2],[3,7],[8,11],[12,12]]))})\nmd`2d6: ${mreaction}`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 14.1: Monster Reaction Roll Table\n\n\nAdjusted Die Roll\nResult\n\n\n\n\n2 or less\nImmediate Attack\n\n\n3-7\nUnfavorable\n\n\n8-11\nFavorable\n\n\n12 or more\nVery Favorable\n\n\n\n\n\nA result of 2 or less means that the player characters have so offended the monsters that they attack immediately. An Unfavorable result means that the monsters do not like the player characters, and will attack if they may reasonably do so. A Favorable result simply means that the monsters will consider letting the player characters live if they choose to parley; it does not necessarily mean that the monsters like the player characters. A Very Favorable result means that the monsters (or perhaps only the monster leader) do, in fact, like the player characters; this does not mean that the monsters will just hand over their treasure, but it does indicate that they may choose to cooperate with the player characters in mutually beneficial ways.\nAs always, interpreting the results of this roll is left to the GM, who may choose to alter the result if he or she believes a different result would be more enjoyable to play out than the one rolled.\n\n\nInitiative\nEach round, 1d6 is rolled for Initiative for each character or monster. This roll is adjusted by the character’s Dexterity bonus. High numbers act first. Any characters/monsters with equal numbers act simultaneously. The GM may make single rolls for groups of identical monsters at his or her option.\nAs the GM counts down the Initiative numbers, each character or monster may act on his or her number. If desired, a combatant can choose to wait until a later number to act. If a player states that he or she is waiting for another character or monster to act, then the player character’s action takes place on the same Initiative number as the creature he or she is waiting for. In this case, the player character’s action is simultaneous with the creature waited for, just as if they had rolled the same number.\nA character using a weapon with a long reach (spears, for instance) may choose to attack a closing opponent on the closing opponent’s number and thus attack simultaneously with the opponent, even if the character rolled lower for Initiative.\n\n\nCombat\nEach character or creature involved in combat may move, if desired, up to its encounter movement distance, and then attack, if any opponent is in range, when its Initiative number comes up. After attacking, a character or creature may not move again until the next round.\nOpponents more than 5’ apart may move freely, but once two opposing figures are within 5’ of each other, they are “engaged” and must abide by the rules under Disengaging From Melee, below.\n\n\nRunning\nCharacters may choose to run; a running character is not normally allowed to attack (but see Charging, below). Running characters can move at double their normal encounter movement rate. Characters are allowed to run a number of rounds equal to 2 times the character’s Constitution, after which they are exhausted and may only walk (at the normal encounter rate). For monsters not having a given Constitution, allow the monster to run for 24 rounds. Exhausted characters or creatures must rest for at least a turn before running again.\n\n\nManeuverability\nThe following rules may be considered optional. They are hardly needed for most dungeon adventures, but will add measurably to combat situations in the wilderness, especially in waterborne combat situations or when some or all combatants are flying.\nCharacters, creatures, and vehicles of various sorts have a turning distance. This is given as a distance in feet in parentheses after their movement rate, and it determines how far they must move between facing changes when moving about in combat.\nAll normal player characters, and in fact most moderately sized creatures which walk on the ground, have a turning distance of 5’. If no turning distance is given for a creature, assume that it is 5’.\nIn general, a facing change is any turn of up to 90o (a right-angle turn); on a square-gridded map, this means turning to face directly to the right or left of the figure’s current facing. A half-turn (45º) still counts as a full facing change. If using hexes, “diagonal” movement is not available, so a facing change is the 60º turn to face toward the hex-side to the right or left of the current facing.\nThere are a few exceptions to this rule:\nFirst, any creature that does not move away from its starting position during the combat round may make as many facing changes as desired (though circumstances, such as trying to turn a horse around in a narrow corridor, may prevent this).\nIncorporeal flying creatures, such as spectres, can turn freely at any point while moving.\nCreatures which are running (moving at double speed) may not make facing changes of more than 60º, and their turning distance increases by 10’ (or, if it is 5’ normally, it increases to 10’).\nAlso, most creatures can shift one space laterally while preserving their facing (this is called “sidestepping”), but this may only be done when moving at normal (“walking”) speed, not at fast (“running”) speed. “One space” means either 5’ or 10’, depending on the map or board being used.\n\n\nClimbing and Diving\nFor battles involving three dimensions, each creature or vehicle has an altitude (when flying) or depth (underwater). For air or sea battles, at least one of the creatures or vehicles should start at an altitude/depth of 0, and a new 0 level can be established at any time, to simplify play, by adjusting the altitudes of each creature or vehicle.\nA winged flier can gain up to 10’ of altitude after moving forward by the distance shown for its maneuverability class, and can dive (lose altitude in a controlled fashion) at up to twice the normal movement rate; if the creature does not move horizontally by at least one-third its normal speed, it will stall, being forced to dive at maximum rate for one round. Floating creatures or vehicles (balloons, fly spell, flying carpets, etc.) can climb vertically without horizontal motion up to half the normal movement rate, but such “floaters” can only descend at the normal movement rate, unless they have lost the ability to float entirely.\n\n\nCharging\nUnder some circumstances, characters or creatures may be allowed to attack after a running move. This is called a charge, and some specific limitations apply. First, the charging character or creature must move at least 10 feet, and may move up to double his or her normal movement rate, as given above. The movement must be in a more or less straight line toward the intended target, and the path to the target must be reasonably clear. Finally, the attacker must be using a weapon such as a spear, lance, or pole arm which is suitable for use while charging. Certain monsters, especially including those with horns, are able to use natural attacks when charging. If the attacker does not have line of sight to the opponent at the start of the charge, that opponent can’t be charged.\nThe attack made after the charge is made at +2 on the attack roll. The charging character or creature takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class for the remainder of the round. If the attack hits, it does double damage.\nSet Weapon Against Charge: Spears, pole arms, and certain other piercing weapons deal double damage when “set” (braced against the ground or floor) and used against a charging creature. For this to be done, the character or creature being charged must have equal or better Initiative; this counts as holding an action: both attacker and defender act on the attacker’s Initiative number and are therefore simultaneous.\n\n\nEvasion and Pursuit\nSometimes a party of adventurers will want nothing more than to avoid a group of monsters (or sometimes, it’s the monsters avoiding the adventurers). If one group is surprised, and the other is not, the unsurprised group may be able to escape automatically (unless something prevents them from making an exit). Otherwise, those wanting to evade the encounter begin doing so on their Initiative numbers. Note that the rules above for Disengaging From Melee will naturally apply to any combatant who is in reach of an enemy.\nThe GM may easily play out the pursuit, following along on their map (note that the players can’t draw maps while they run headlong through the dungeon or wilderness area). Any time a character must pass through a doorway, make a hard turn, etc., the GM may require a saving throw vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added); if the save is failed, the character has fallen at that point and moves no further that round; they may stand up and make a full move (but not a double move) on their Initiative number in the next round.\nIf the fleeing characters or creatures are ever able to get beyond the pursuer’s sight for a full round, they have evaded pursuit… the pursuers have lost them.\n\n\nDisengaging From Melee\nWhen any combatant is within reach of the melee attacks of at least one enemy, that combatant is considered to be engaged. Such a combatant may disengage in one of two ways:\nFirst, the combatant may simply flee, turning away from all opponents they are engaged with and moving more than half normal movement. All opponents with whom they are engaged are allowed a “parting shot” with a +2 bonus to attack, even if that opponent has already made all attacks for the round. Opponents who have multiple melee attacks per round make just one; for instance, a tiger with the usual “2 claws, 1 bite” routine could only claw once or bite once.\nTo avoid the parting shot, the combatant may choose to withdraw, i.e. back away by up to half normal movement. After a withdrawal, the character may still attack at any point later in the same round if an opponent is within reach\n\n\nAttacking Maneuvers\nTo roll “to hit,” the attacker rolls 1d20 and adds his or her attack bonus (AB), as shown on the Attack Bonus table, as well as Strength bonus (if performing a melee attack) or Dexterity bonus (if performing a missile or ranged attack) and any other adjustments required by the situation. If the total is equal to or greater than the opponent’s Armor Class, the attack hits and damage is rolled. A natural “1” on the die roll is always a failure. A natural “20” is always a hit, if the opponent can be hit at all (for example, monsters that can only be hit by silver or magic weapons cannot be hit by normal weapons, so a natural “20” with a normal weapon will not hit such a monster).\n\n\nTable 14.2: Attack Bonus Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFighter Level\nCleric or Thief Level\nMagic-User Level\nMonster Hit Dice\nAttack Bonus\n\n\n\n\n NM \n\n\nless than 1\n+0\n\n\n1\n1-2\n1-3\n1\n+1\n\n\n2-3\n3-4\n4-5\n2\n+2\n\n\n4\n5-6\n6-8\n3\n+3\n\n\n5-6\n7-8\n9-12\n4\n+4\n\n\n7\n9-11\n13-15\n5\n+5\n\n\n8-10\n12-14\n16-18\n6\n+6\n\n\n11-12\n15-17\n19-20\n7\n+7\n\n\n13-15\n18-20\n\n8-9\n+8\n\n\n16-17\n\n\n10-11\n+9\n\n\n18-20\n\n\n12-13\n+10\n\n\n\n\n\n14-15\n+11\n\n\n\n\n\n16-19\n+12\n\n\n\n\n\n20-23\n+13\n\n\n\n\n\n24-27\n+14\n\n\n\n\n\n28-31\n+15\n\n\n\n\n\n32 or more\n+16\n\n\n\n\n\nAttacking from Behind\nAttacks made from behind an opponent usually receive a +2 attack bonus. This does not combine with the Sneak Attack ability.\n\n\nNormal Men\nA note about normal men: The NM entry in the table above is for normal men, also known as zero level characters. These characters represent the artisans, shopkeepers, scullery maids, and other non-adventurer characters who will appear in the game. All such characters are NPCs, of course. Demi-human races have few if any zero-level characters among their numbers; the vast majority of “normal men” are humans.\nAverage zero-level humans have 1d4 hit points, and usually are not proficient with any weapons except bare hands. Green troops (those who have not been in battle yet) are zero-level, but they have 1d6 hit points and are allowed to use any weapon allowed to a Fighter.\nIt is recommended not to waste time in detailing the ability score or other statistics of such characters further; they are normal, as in “average,” and so very few would have extreme statistics. A blacksmith might be credited with a Strength score of 13 or more, or a savant with Intelligence of 16 or more, but in general such things need not be detailed for most of these characters.\n\n\nMonster Attack Bonus\nWhen looking up a monster’s hit dice on the Attack Bonus Table, ignore all “plus” or “minus” values; so a monster with 3+2 hit dice, or one with 3-1, is still treated as just 3 hit dice. The exception is monsters with 1-1 or lower hit dice, which are considered less than one hit die and have an attack bonus of +0.\n\n\nMelee Combat\nMelee occurs after a character has closed for combat and strikes at a monster or other foe. Melee weapons or attacks may generally only be used against foes who are engaged with the attacker (as described above).\n\n\nMissile Fire\nMissile weapons may be used to attack foes at a distance. The distance the attacker is from his target affects the attack roll, as shown on the Missile Weapon Ranges table. In general, opponents within Short range are attacked at +1 on the die, those beyond Short range but within Medium range are attacked at +0, and those beyond Medium but within Long range are attacked at -2. Foes beyond Long range cannot be effectively attacked.\nIf a character attempts to use a missile weapon against a foe who is within 5’ of him or her (i.e. who is engaged with the shooter), a penalty of -5 is applied to the attack roll. This is due to the shooter dodging around to avoid the foe’s attacks. The only exception is if the attacker is behind the target creature and undetected, or that creature is distracted so as to not be able to attack the shooter; in these cases, apply the usual +1 bonus (+3 total bonus if attacking from behind).\n\n\nCover and Concealment\nIn certain situations, the intended target of a missile (or melee) attack may have cover or concealment of some kind. Cover is defined as “hard” protection such as that afforded by a thick tree trunk or stone wall, that is, anything that will stop or slow a missile weapon. Concealment is “soft” cover like fog or light foliage that makes the target difficult to see but does not affect the missile itself. Cover or concealment makes it more difficult to strike an intended target, and thus a penalty will be applied to the attacker’s die roll depending upon how much of the target is protected from attack. For concealment the attack penalty should range from -1 (25% obscured) to -4 (90% obscured). For hard cover, these penalties should be doubled.\n\n\nMissile Weapon Rate of Fire\nIn general, missile weapons are allowed a single attack per round, just as are melee weapons. However, crossbows are an exception, as reloading a crossbow between shots is time-consuming.\nA light crossbow can be fired once per two rounds, and the user may not perform any other actions (including movement) during the “reloading” round. A heavy crossbow can be fired just once per three rounds, again requiring the user to spend two rounds doing nothing other than cocking and loading the weapon in order to fire it again.\nSiege engines also fire less often than ordinary weapons. The rate of fire for such a weapon is presented as a fraction, indicating the number of attacks per round; for example, 1/6 means one attack every six rounds.\nOf course, the user of such a weapon may drop or sling the weapon and switch to another weapon rather than reloading. Also, it is possible (especially when defending a position) to load more than one crossbow in advance and then switch weapons each round until all have been fired. In a dungeon environment this sort of strategy is unlikely, of course.\n\n\nGrenade-Like Missiles\nWhen throwing grenade-like missiles (flasks of oil, etc.), a successful attack roll indicates a direct hit. Otherwise, the GM will roll 1d10 and consult the diagram below to determine where the missile hit. Treat each number as representing a 10’ square area.\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: Grenade AOT\n\n\n\n\nMissiles That Miss\nWith the exception of grenade-like missiles, missile weapons which miss the intended target are normally considered lost. However, if the weapon is fired into a melee where allies of the shooter are involved, and the attack misses, it may hit one of the allied creatures. The GM should decide which allies may be hit, and roll attacks against each until a hit is made or all possible targets are exhausted. These attack rolls are made with the shooter’s normal attack bonus, just as if he or she intended to attack the allied creature. However, the GM must make these rolls, not the player.\nThis rule is applied to attacks made by monsters, when appropriate. However, the GM still makes the rolls.\nThis rule is intentionally vague; the GM must decide when and how to apply it based on the circumstances of the battle. It is recommended that no more than three allies be “tried” in this way, but the GM may make an exception as he or she sees fit.\n\n\nOil\nA flask of oil can be used as a grenade-like missile. The oil must be set afire in order to inflict damage; otherwise the oil is just slippery. Assuming some means of igniting the oil is at hand, a direct hit to a creature deals 1d8 points of fire damage, plus in the next round the target takes an additional 1d8 points of damage, unless he or she spends the round extinguishing the flames by some reasonable means. The GM must judge the method used; rolling on the floor (assuming it’s not oily also) or covering the flames with a wet blanket are good methods, for instance, while pouring or splashing water on burning oil does little good. In any event, a flask of burning oil only causes damage for two rounds at most.\nIf the oil is ignited by some sort of wick or fuse, then all other creatures within 5 feet of the point of impact receive 1d6 points of fire damage from the splash. A save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid this damage. If the flask does not hit the intended target (as described under Grenade-Like Missiles, above), then that creature may still take damage from the splash, and receives a saving throw. No saving throw is allowed for a creature which has received a direct hit.\nA flask of oil spilled or splattered on the ground will burn for 10 rounds. Those attempting to cross the burning oil will receive 1d6 points of fire damage each round they are in it (with no saving throw in this case).\nFire-resistant creatures, including creatures having fire-based abilities, are not damaged by burning oil.\n\n\nHoly Water\nHoly water damages undead creatures. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a grenade-like missile; the flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, it must be opened and poured out onto the target, generally requiring the attacker to be adjacent to the target.\nA direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 1d8 points of damage to an undead creature. In addition, each such creature within 5 feet of the point of impact receives 1d6 points of damage from the splash. Holy water is only effective for one round.\n\n\nDamage\nIf an attack hits, the attacker rolls damage as given for the weapon. Melee attacks apply the Strength bonus or penalty to the damage dice, as do thrown missile weapons such as daggers or spears. Usually, attacks with bows or crossbows do not gain the Strength bonus, but sling bullets or stones do.\nAlso, magic weapons will add their bonuses to damage (and cursed weapons will apply their penalty). Note that, regardless of any penalties to damage, any successful hit will do at least one point of damage.\nAs explained elsewhere, a creature or character reduced to 0 hit points is dead.\n\n\nSubduing Damage\nAttacks made with the “flat of the blade” for non-lethal damage are made at a -4 attack penalty and do half damage. Most weapons can be used this way; only those with penetration or slashing features on all sides cannot.\nIf a character is reduced to zero hit points who has taken at least some subduing damage, the character becomes unconscious rather than dying. (Any further subduing damage is then considered killing damage, allowing the possibility that someone might be beaten to death.) A character knocked out in this way, but not subsequently killed, will wake up with 1 hit point in 1d4 turns, or can be awakened (with 1 hit point) by someone else after 2d10 rounds.\n\n\nBrawling\nSometimes a character will attack without a weapon, striking with a fist or foot. This is called brawling. Normal characters do 1d3 points of subduing damage with a punch, 1d4 with a kick; kicks are rolled at a -2 attack penalty. A character in no armor or leather armor cannot successfully punch or kick a character in metal armor, and in fact, if this is attempted the damage is applied to the attacker instead of the defender. The GM must decide which monsters can be successfully attacked this way. All character classes may engage in brawling; there is no “weapon” restriction in this case.\n\n\nWrestling\nA wrestling attack requires a successful melee attack roll, where success indicates the attacker has grabbed his or her opponent. This hold is maintained until the attacker releases it or the defender makes a save vs. Death Ray, which is attempted at the defender’s next action (according to Initiative). A successful wrestling attack causes the attacker to move into the same “space” as the defender (if miniature figures are used).\nAfter achieving a hold on an opponent, the attacker can automatically inflict unarmed damage (as if striking with a fist), prevent a held opponent from speaking, use simple magic items such as rings, or take any other action the GM allows. The attacker may also attempt to acquire an item the opponent is holding (such as a weapon) or attempt to move the opponent (as described below). A held character may be voluntarily released whenever the attacker so desires.\nThe attacker can’t draw or use a weapon or use a wand, staff, scroll or potion, escape another’s wrestling attack, cast a spell, or pin another character while holding an opponent.\nMoving the Opponent: The attacker can move up to one-half speed (bringing the defender along) with a successful attack roll, if the attacker is strong enough to carry or drag the defender.\nAcquiring an Object: The attacker may attempt to take an item away from the defender. This requires an additional attack roll; if the roll fails, the defender may immediately attempt an attack roll (even if he or she has already attacked this round) which, if successful, results in the defender pinning the attacker; or, the defender may choose to escape instead of reversing the hold.\nActions Allowed to the Defender: The target of a successful hold is usually immobile (but not helpless) at least until his or her next action, as determined by Initiative. Such characters suffer a penalty of -4 to AC against opponents other than the attacker.\nIf the defender is significantly stronger and/or larger than the attacker, he or she may move at up to one-half speed, dragging the attacker along.\nOn the defender’s next action, he or she can try to escape the pin with a saving throw vs. Death Ray; the defender must apply the better of his or her Strength or Dexterity bonuses (or penalties) on this roll. If the escape roll succeeds, the defender finishes the action by moving into any space adjacent to the attacker.\nIf more than one attacker has a hold on a particular defender, a successful escape roll frees the defender from just one of those attackers.\nHeld characters may also use simple magic items such as rings. A character being held may not normally cast a spell, even if he or she has not been silenced by the attacker.\nMultiple Opponents: Several combatants can be involved in a wrestling match. Up to four combatants can wrestle a single opponent of normal size in a given round. Creatures that are smaller than the attacker count for half, while creatures that are larger count at least double (as determined by the GM). Note that, after an opponent is pinned, other attackers benefit from the -4 AC penalty applied to the defender. However, this AC penalty is not cumulative (that is, each successful attack does not lower the defender’s AC further).\nIt is also possible for another character to attack the attacker in an ongoing wrestling bout. In this case, a successful hold on the attacker grants the original defender a +4 bonus on subsequent escape rolls.\nWrestling With Monsters: In general, the rules above can be used not only when character races wrestle but also when humanoid monsters are involved. The GM will decide whether or not to allow wrestling involving non-humanoid creatures on a case-by-case basis; if this is allowed, the following adjustments apply:\nCreatures with extra grasping appendages (more than the usual two) gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls or saving throws for each such appendage. This includes creatures with feet capable of grasping (such as monkeys or apes, giant spiders, etc.)\nLarge creatures able to fly may attempt to carry off their opponents (even if the flying creature is the defender).\nWrestling attacks against creatures with touch attacks (such as wights) will cause the attacker to suffer one such attack automatically every round.\n\n\nMorale\nNPCs and monsters don’t always fight to the death; in fact, most will try to avoid death whenever possible. Each monster listing includes the monster’s Morale score, a figure between 2 and 12. To make a Morale check, roll 2d6; if the roll is equal to or less than the Morale score, the monster or monsters are willing to stand and fight. If the roll is higher than the score, the monster has lost its nerve. Monsters with a Morale score of 12 never fail a Morale check; they always fight to the death.\nIn general, Morale is checked when monster(s) first encounter opposition, and again when the monster party is reduced to half strength (by numbers if more than one monster, or by hit points if the monster is alone). For this purpose, monsters incapacitated by sleep, charm, or hold magic are counted as if dead.\nThe Game Master may apply adjustments to a monster’s Morale score in some situations, at his or her discretion. Generally, adjustments should not total more than +2 or -2. No adjustment is ever applied to a Morale score of 12.\nA monster that fails a Morale check will generally attempt to flee; intelligent monsters or NPCs may attempt to surrender, if the GM so desires.\nNote that special rules apply to retainers; see the relevant rules in the Hirelings section, above.\n\n\nTurning the Undead\nClerics can Turn the undead, that is, drive away undead monsters by means of faith alone. The Cleric brandishes his or her holy symbol and calls upon the power of his or her divine patron. The player rolls 1d20 and tells the GM the result. Note that the player should always roll, even if the GM knows the character can’t succeed (or can’t fail), as telling the player whether or not to roll may reveal too much.\nThe GM looks up the Cleric’s level on the Clerics vs. Undead table, and cross-references it with the undead type or Hit Dice. (The Hit Dice row is provided for use with undead monsters not found in the Core Rules; only use the Hit Dice row if the specific type of undead monster is not on the table and no guidance is given in the monster’s description.) If the table indicates “No” for that combination, it is not possible for the Cleric to affect that type of undead monster. If the table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on 1d20 to Turn that sort of undead. If the table says “T” for that combination, that type of undead is automatically affected (no roll needed). If the result shown is a “D,” then that sort of undead will be Damaged (and possibly destroyed) rather than merely Turned.\nIf the roll is a success, 2d6 hit dice of undead monsters are affected; surplus hit dice are lost (so if zombies are being Turned and a roll of 7 is made, at most 3 zombies can be Turned), but a minimum of one creature will always be affected if the first roll succeeds.\nIf a mixed group of undead (say, a wight and a pair of zombies) is to be Turned, the player still rolls just once. The result is checked against the weakest sort first (the zombies), and if they are successfully Turned, the same result is checked against the next higher type of undead. Likewise, the 2d6 hit dice are rolled only once. For example, if the group described above is to be Turned by a 2nd level Cleric, he or she would first need to have rolled a 15 or higher to Turn the zombies. If this is a success, 2d6 are rolled; assuming the 2d6 roll is a 7, this would Turn both zombies and leave a remainder of 3 hit dice of effect. Wights are, in fact, 3 hit die monsters, so assuming the original 1d20 roll was a 20, the wight is Turned as well. Obviously, were it a group of 3 zombies and a wight, the 2d6 roll would have to be a total of 9 or higher to affect them all.\nIf a Cleric succeeds at Turning the undead, but not all undead monsters present are affected, he or she may try again in the next round to affect those which remain. If any roll to Turn the Undead fails, that Cleric may not attempt to Turn Undead again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose.\nUndead monsters which are Turned flee from the Cleric and his or her party at maximum movement. If the party pursue and corner the Turned undead, they may resume attacking the party; but if left alone, the monsters will not return or attempt to attack the Cleric or those near him or her for at least 2d4 turns.\nUndead monsters subject to a D (Damaged) result suffer 1d8 damage per level of the Cleric (roll once and apply the same damage to all undead monsters affected); those reduced to zero hit points are utterly destroyed, being blasted into little more than dust. Those surviving this damage are still Turned as above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleric Lvl\nSkeleton\nZombie\nGhoul\nWight\nWraith\nMummy\nSpectre\nVampire\nGhost\n\n\n\n\n\n1 HD\n2 HD\n3 HD\n4 HD\n5 HD\n6 HD\n7 HD\n8 HD\n9+ HD\n\n\n1\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n2\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n3\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n4\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n5\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n7\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n8\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\nNo\n\n\n9\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\nNo\n\n\n10\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\nNo\n\n\n11\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\nNo\n\n\n12\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n20\n\n\n13\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n19\n\n\n14\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n18\n\n\n15\nD\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n17\n\n\n16\nD\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n15\n\n\n17\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n13\n\n\n18\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n11\n\n\n19\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\n2\n5\n9\n\n\n20\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nT\nT\n3\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof level = Inputs.select([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20], {value:1, label: \"Cleric Level\"})\n\nviewof r = Inputs.select([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20], {value:1, label: \"Roll\"})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport {turnUndead} from \"./custom.js\"\n\nres = turnUndead(level,r)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Drain\nSometimes characters are exposed to energy drain from undead or evil magic. Such energy drain is manifested in the form of “negative levels.” For each negative level a victim receives, he or she suffers a semi-permanent loss of one hit die worth of hit points, a penalty of -1 on all attack and saving throw rolls (and any other roll made on 1d20), and -5% to any percentile roll such as thief abilities. In addition, an affected spell caster loses access to one of his or her highest-level spell slots. The victim may or may not be allowed a saving throw to resist the effect (depending on the specific monster type).\nIf the character’s hit points are reduced to zero or less by means of energy drain, the victim is immediately slain. If the energy drain is caused by an undead monster, the victim will usually be transformed into that sort of undead (exact details vary by type of monster).\nNegative levels may be removed by magic, such as the restoration spell. When a negative level is to be removed, divide the total number of hit points lost by the number of negative levels (rounding normally) to determine how many hit points are restored.\nFor example, a character suffers three negative levels of energy drain. The hit point losses rolled were 6, 5, and 2, for a total of 13 points lost. The first negative level removed restores 13 / 3 = 4.3333 hit points (which is rounded to 4 even). Now the character has two negative levels and has lost 9 hit points. The next time a negative level is removed, the character recovers 9 / 2 = 4.5 hit points, which is rounded to 5 even. Now the character has one negative level and 4 hit points lost. Removal of the last negative level will restore the remaining 4 points.\nThose who have suffered energy drain generally have a gaunt, haggard look about them, noticeable by observant characters.\n\n\nHealing and Rest\nCharacters recover 1 hit point of damage every day, provided that normal sleep is possible. Characters who choose full bedrest regain an additional hit point each evening.\nNormal characters require 6 hours sleep out of every 24. Subtract from this number of hours the character’s Constitution bonus; so a character with 18 Constitution needs only 3 hours sleep per night (and a character with 3 Constitution needs 9 hours). Note that these figures are minimums; given a choice, most characters would prefer to sleep two or more hours longer.\nCharacters who get less than the required amount of sleep suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws (as well as not receiving any hit points of healing). For each additional night where sufficient sleep is not received, the penalty becomes one point worse. Regardless of how long the character has gone without adequate sleep, the normal amount of sleep will remove these penalties.\n\n\nConstitution Point Losses\nAny character who has lost Constitution points temporarily (such as due to a disease) may regain them with normal rest. The rate of recovery is one point per day, awarded each morning when the character awakens from a normal night’s sleep. If more than one Constitution point was lost, the character must make a save vs. Death Ray (without adjustments) to regain the final point; failure results in a permanent loss of that point.\nIf a Constitution loss results in a lower bonus or penalty, the character’s maximum hit points must be reduced appropriately; for instance, a character reduced from 16 to 15 Constitution goes from +2 to +1, thus losing one hit point per die rolled. If a reduction in maximum hit points reduces that figure to less than the character’s current hit points, reduce the current hit points to the new maximum hit point figure immediately.\nWhen regaining Constitution, any increase that increases the character’s Constitution bonus results in the restoration of the hit points lost due to the reduction, added to the maximum hit point figure only. Current hit points will not be improved in this fashion, but rather must be regained by normal healing.\n\n\nFalling Damage\nCharacters suffer 1d6 damage per 10’ fallen, up to a maximum 20d6. Fractional distances are rounded to the nearest whole number, so that a fall of 1-4’ does no damage, 5’-14’ does 1d6, etc.\n\n\nDeafness and Blindness\nA deafened creature can react only to what it can see or feel, is surprised on 1-3 on 1d6, and suffers a -1 penalty to its Initiative rolls. A blinded creature is surprised on 1-4 on 1d6, suffers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls, a -4 penalty to its Armor Class, and a -2 penalty to its Initiative rolls. These effects are modified when dealing with monsters having unusual sensory abilities; for example, bats may be affected by deafness as if blinded instead.\nThese penalties are for characters or creatures recently handicapped. Those who are normally blind or deaf may have reduced penalties at the GM’s option.\nNote that the penalty for attacking an invisible opponent is the same as the penalty for attacking blind, that is, -4 on the attack roll. Do not apply this twice… a blind character attacking an invisible opponent is no worse off than if they were attacking a visible one\n\n\nAttacking a Vehicle\nAttacks against vehicles (such as wagons or ships) are made against Armor Class 11. Each vehicle has listed Hardness and Hit Point values. Roll damage against the vehicle, and then reduce that damage by the Hardness value. Any excess damage is applied to the vehicle.\nIf the vehicle takes damage equal to or greater than the listed HP on one side, it is reduced to half speed due to wheel damage or a hull breach; if it takes this much again, it is immobilized, and this much damage will sink a ship.\n\n\nRepairing a Vehicle\nDamage done to a vehicle may be restored at a rate of 1d4 hit points per crew member per hour of labor. However, a vehicle can only be restored to 90% of its maximum hit points by field repairs; a damaged ship must be put into drydock and repaired by a shipwright and his crew, while a wagon, cart or chariot will require a wagonmaker to repair them. Costs of such repairs are left to the Game Master to decide.\n\n\nSaving Throws\nSaving throws represent the ability of a character or creature to resist or avoid special attacks, such as spells or poisons. Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll, with a target number based on the character’s class and level; for monsters, a comparable class and level are provided for the purpose of determining the monster’s saving throw figures. A natural (unadjusted) roll of 1 on a saving throw is always a failure, while a natural 20 is always a success.\nThe five categories of saving throw as follows: Death Ray or Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, Dragon Breath, and Spells. Spells and monster special attacks will indicate which category applies (when a saving throw is allowed), but in some unusual situations the Game Master will need to choose a category. One way to make this choice is to interpret the categories metaphorically. For example, a GM might be writing an adventure wherein there is a trap that pours burning oil on the hapless adventurers. Avoiding the oil might be considered similar to avoiding Dragon Breath. Or perhaps a stone idol shoots beams of energy from its glaring eyes when approached. This attack may be considered similar to a Magic Wand, or if especially potent, a Spell. The saving throw vs. Death Ray is often used as a “catch all” save versus many of the “ordinary” dangers encountered in a dungeon environment.\nIn general, saving throw rolls are not adjusted by ability score bonus or penalty figures. There are a few exceptions:\n\nPoison saving throws are always adjusted by the character’s Constitution modifier.\nSaving throws against illusions (such as phantasmal force) are always adjusted by the character’s Intelligence modifier.\nSaving throws against charm spells (and other forms of mind control) are adjusted by the character’s Wisdom modifier.\n\nThe GM may decide on other saving throw adjustments as he or she sees fit.\n\nItem Saving Throws\nArea effects (such as fireball or lightning bolt spells) may damage items carried by a character as well as injuring the character. For simplicity, assume that items carried are unaffected if the character or creature carrying them makes his or her own saving throw. However, very fragile items (paper vs. fire, glass vs. physical impact, etc.) may still be considered subject to damage even if the bearer makes his or her save.\nIn any case where one or more items may be subject to damage, use the saving throw roll of the bearer to determine if the item is damaged or not. For example, a character holding an open spellbook is struck by a fireball spell; he or she must save vs. Spells, and then save again at the same odds for the spellbook.\nThe GM should feel free to amend this rule as he or she wishes; for instance, a backpack full of fragile items might be given a single saving throw rather than laboriously rolling for each and every item.\n\n\nSaving Throw Tables by Class\n\n\nTable 14.3: Cleric Saving Throws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDeath Ray / Poison\nMagic Wands\nParalysis / Petrify\nDragon Breath\nSpells\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n11\n12\n14\n16\n15\n\n\n\n2-3\n10\n11\n13\n15\n14\n\n\n\n4-5\n9\n10\n13\n15\n14\n\n\n\n6-7\n9\n10\n12\n14\n13\n\n\n\n8-9\n8\n9\n12\n14\n13\n\n\n\n10-11\n8\n9\n11\n13\n12\n\n\n\n12-13\n7\n8\n11\n13\n12\n\n\n\n14-15\n7\n8\n10\n12\n11\n\n\n\n16-17\n6\n7\n10\n12\n11\n\n\n\n18-19\n6\n7\n9\n11\n10\n\n\n\n20\n5\n6\n9\n11\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 14.4: Fighter Saving Throws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDeath Ray / Poison\nMagic Wands\nParalysis / Petrify\nDragon Breath\nSpells\n\n\n\n\n\nNM\n13\n14\n15\n16\n18\n\n\n\n1\n12\n13\n14\n15\n17\n\n\n\n2-3\n11\n12\n14\n15\n16\n\n\n\n4-5\n11\n11\n13\n14\n15\n\n\n\n6-7\n10\n11\n12\n14\n15\n\n\n\n8-9\n9\n10\n12\n13\n14\n\n\n\n10-11\n9\n9\n11\n12\n13\n\n\n\n12-13\n8\n9\n10\n12\n13\n\n\n\n14-15\n7\n8\n10\n11\n12\n\n\n\n16-17\n7\n7\n9\n10\n11\n\n\n\n18-19\n6\n7\n8\n10\n11\n\n\n\n20\n5\n6\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 14.5: Magic User Saving Throws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDeath Ray / Poison\nMagic Wands\nParalysis / Petrify\nDragon Breath\nSpells\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n13\n14\n13\n16\n15\n\n\n\n2-3\n13\n14\n13\n15\n14\n\n\n\n4-5\n12\n13\n12\n15\n13\n\n\n\n6-7\n12\n12\n11\n14\n13\n\n\n\n8-9\n11\n11\n10\n14\n12\n\n\n\n10-11\n11\n10\n9\n13\n11\n\n\n\n12-13\n10\n10\n9\n13\n11\n\n\n\n14-15\n10\n9\n8\n12\n10\n\n\n\n16-17\n9\n8\n7\n12\n9\n\n\n\n18-19\n9\n7\n6\n11\n9\n\n\n\n20\n8\n6\n5\n11\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 14.6: Thief Saving Throws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDeath Ray / Poison\nMagic Wands\nParalysis / Petrify\nDragon Breath\nSpells\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n13\n14\n13\n16\n15\n\n\n\n2-3\n12\n14\n12\n15\n14\n\n\n\n4-5\n11\n13\n12\n14\n13\n\n\n\n6-7\n11\n13\n11\n13\n13\n\n\n\n8-9\n10\n12\n11\n12\n12\n\n\n\n10-11\n9\n12\n10\n11\n11\n\n\n\n12-13\n9\n10\n10\n10\n11\n\n\n\n14-15\n8\n10\n9\n9\n10\n\n\n\n16-17\n7\n9\n9\n8\n9\n\n\n\n18-19\n7\n9\n8\n7\n9\n\n\n\n20\n6\n8\n8\n6\n8"

    "title": "15  Monsters Intro",
    "section": "Terms",
    "text": "Terms\nName: The first thing given for each monster is its name (or its most common name, if the monster is known by more than one). If an asterisk appears after the monster’s name, it indicates that the monster is only able to be hit by special weapons (such as silver or magical weapons, or creatures affected only by fire, etc.) which makes the monster harder to defeat.\nArmor Class: This line gives the creature’s AC for normal combat. If the monster customarily wears armor, the first listed AC value is with that armor, and the second, in parentheses, is unarmored. Some monsters are only able to be hit (damaged) by silver or magical weapons; these are indicated with (s); some monsters may only be hit with magical weapons, indicated by (m)\nHit Dice: This is the creature’s number of hit dice, including any bonus hit points. Monsters always roll eight sided dice (d8) for hit points, unless otherwise noted. So for example, a creature with 3+2 hit dice rolls 3d8 and adds 2 points to the total. A few monsters may be marked as having ½ hit dice; this means 1d4 points, and the creature has “less than one hit die” for attack bonus purposes\nOne or two asterisks (*) may appear after the hit dice figure; where present, they indicate a Special Ability Bonus to experience points (XP) awarded for the monster. See Character Advancement.\nIf the monster’s Attack Bonus (see Table 14.2) is different than its number of Hit Dice, for convenience the Attack Bonus will be listed in parentheses after the Hit Dice figure.\nMovement: This line gives the monster’s movement rate, or rates for those monsters able to move in more than one fashion. For example, Bugbears have a normal walking movement of 30’, and this is all that is listed for them. Mermaids can only move about in the water, and so their movement is given as Swim 40’. Pegasi can both walk and fly, so their movement is listed as 80’ Fly 160’.\nIn addition, a distance may appear in parentheses after a movement figure; this is the creature’s turning distance. If a turning distance is not listed, assume 5’.\nAttacks: The number (and sometimes type or types) of attacks the monster can perform. For example, Goblins may attack once with a weapon, so they are marked 1 weapon. Ghouls are marked 2 claws/1 bite as they can attack with both claws and also bite in one round. Some monsters have alternate attacks, such as the triceratops with an attack of 1 gore or 1 trample which means that the creature can do a gore attack or a trample attack, but not both in the same round.\nDamage: The damage figures caused by successful attacks by the monster. Generally this will be defined in terms of one or more die rolls.\nNo. Appearing: This is given in terms of one or more die rolls. Monsters that only appear underground and have no lairs will have a single die roll; those that have lairs and/or those that can be found in the wilderness will be noted appropriately. For example, a monster noted as “1d6, Wild 2d6, Lair 3d6” is encountered in groups of 1d6 individuals in a dungeon setting, 2d6 individuals in the wilderness, or 3d6 individuals in a lair.\nNote that number appearing applies to combatants. Non-combatant monsters (juveniles, and sometimes females) do not count in this number. The text of the monster description should explain this in detail where it matters, but the GM is always the final arbiter.\nSave As: The character class and level the monster uses for saving throws. Most monsters save as Fighters of a level equal to their hit dice.\nMorale: The number that must be rolled equal to or less than on 2d6 for the monster to pass a Morale Check. Monsters having a Morale of 12 never fail morale checks, and fight until destroyed (or until they have no enemies left).\nTreasure Type: This line reflects how much wealth the creature owns. See the Treasure section for more details. In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.\nXP: The number of experience points awarded for defeating this monster. In some cases, the figure will vary; for instance, Dragons of different age categories will have different XP values. Review the Experience Points awards table in the Adventure section, to calculate the correct figure in these cases."

Such creatures obviously have no treasure.\nCamels are large animals found in arid environments that bear distinctive fatty deposits known as “humps” on their backs. There are two relevant species of camel described here: the far more common one-humped dromedary, and the two-humped Bactrian camel. Statistics presented above are for the dromedary; the Bactrian camel is slower and its movement is given in brackets. A light load for a camel is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 800 pounds.\nDonkeys are hoofed mammals in the same family as the horse. They are smaller, but are strong and hardy. Burros are a similar species, and the statistics herein can be used for either; both varieties are capable of being taken into dungeons as pack animals. A light load for a donkey is up to 70 pounds; a heavy load, up to 140 pounds.\nDraft Horses are large horses bred to be working animals doing hard tasks such as plowing and other farm labor. There are a number of breeds, with varying characteristics, but all share common traits of strength, patience, and a docile temperament. A light load for a draft horse is up to 350 pounds; a heavy load, up to 700 pounds.\nRiding Horses are smaller horses bred and trained for riding. They cannot effectively fight while the rider is mounted. A light load for a riding horse is up to 250 pounds; a heavy load, up to 500 pounds.\nWar Horses are large, powerful horses which are both bred for their size, strength, and combat ability and trained to tolerate the sounds and stresses of battle. They are able to attack while the rider is mounted due to their training. A light load for a warhorse is up to 350 pounds; a heavy load, up to 700 pounds\nMules are a domestic equine hybrid between a donkey and a horse. Mules vary widely in size, and may be of any color. They are more patient, hardier and longer- lived than horses, and are perceived as less obstinate and more intelligent than donkeys. Like donkeys, they are capable of being taken into dungeons as pack animals. A light load for a mule is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 600 pounds.\nA Pony is a variety of small horse. Compared to a larger horse, a pony may have a thicker coat, mane and tail, with proportionally shorter legs, a wider barrel, heavier bone, a thicker neck and a shorter, broader head. Ponies can be trained for war, and the morale in parentheses above is for a war pony; this does not allow them to fight while a rider is mounted, however. A light load for a pony is up to 275 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds."

Soldiers and workers are about 5 to 6 feet long, while queens can grow to a length of 9 feet. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair.\nGiant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets.\nLarge and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length. Though smaller, their colonies have more members, and so their lair treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of giant ants."

A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.\nAn assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.\nA mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine.\nA subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown, and white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it."

They stand between 2½ and 3½ feet tall and typically weigh around 45 pounds. They are pack hunters by nature, shy when encountered singly or in small groups but bold when their numbers are overwhelming. Use the higher morale figure when a barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3 combatants to 1 or more.\nBarklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature and relative lack of strength; all such weapons do 1d4 points of damage on a hit.\nBarklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they excel; a barkling can track almost any living or corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been as much as a day since it passed.\nIn combat barklings usually wear chainmail armor which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor Class given above).\nOne out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP). In barkling encampments, one out of every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In villages of 50 or more there will be a barkling lord of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage. Barklings gain a +1 bonus to their morale as long as they are led by any of their leaders.\nIn addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is present). A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level 1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.\nBarklings are sometimes confused with kobolds, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult."

A basilisk has dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale yellow or white belly. Adults reach a body length of 5 to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a weight of 250 to 400 pounds. There is no particular difference in size between males and females.\nAny living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.\nThe greater basilisk appears identical to the common variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing between 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greater basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare skin must save vs. Poison or die. This effect persists even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20 hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea."

A two hit die black pudding is simply unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split further.\nCold or ice based attacks do not harm a black pudding, but such an attack will paralyze the pudding for one round per die of damage the attack would normally cause.

In addition, there is a 2 in 6 chance that a shaman will be present in a lair. A shaman is equal to an ordinary bugbear statistically, but possesses 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities."

Caecilia live entirely underground. The giant variety grows up to 30’ long and frequently are found in caverns or dungeons. They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.\nA caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid or demi-human (such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers 1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit, fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to the attack roll are applied.\nOnce a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and digest its meal."

Cattle are raised mostly for their meat (beef), leather, and milk. Cattle eat grass and are fairly gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede (run in a group). Anyone caught in the path of the stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as determined by the GM. Male cattle are called bulls, females are cows, and young are calves (calf is singular). If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using their horns to attack. Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure), and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd. A bull will likely attack if he sees quick movements from creatures he might be able to reach with a charge. Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a roughly circular formation with their heads outward, while calves will be kept in the center, though if the opponents are small enough they may instead charge en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.\nA typical small farm with cattle will have a bull, 5d4 cows, and 2d10 calves (but not more than the number of cows).\nAurochs are wild cattle; they are shaggy and rough- looking. Bison are the largest species of wild bovines. All types of bovines tend to behave in the same general way, as described above.\nAn ox is typically a castrated bull used as a draft animal; females may be used, rarely, but males are preferred due to their greater size and strength. Oxen are usually paired as a team to pull a fully-loaded wagon (or the equivalent of 3,000 lb). Oxen require less food and water, being able to eat rough grass better than draft horses, which makes them valuable to merchants with large caravans going over semi-arid prairie."

An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long. They are eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a variety of touch-sensitive “hairs” on their legs to sense the environment around them.\nThese creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.\nAll giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed, attracting wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.\nAny giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not interrupt the monster’s shrieking.\nA giant cave locust can leap up to 60’ horizontally, or up to 30’ up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.\nFinally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10’ away. Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell."

In their natural form (which few creatures ever see) they are pale and pasty looking, slim, around 5½ feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. Their features look unformed and incomplete.\nDopplegangers wish to live a life of ease, and in pursuit of that goal they will seek to take the place of any character they meet who they believe can help them get that kind of life. This usually means separating the victim from any allies and quietly killing them. While a doppleganger can duplicate the appearance of the clothing and equipment worn by a creature, such items are part of the creature and cannot, for example, be laid down or handed to someone. Taking the clothing and equipment of a victim is thus the preferred tactic.\nA doppleganger can mimic the sound of the voice of any living creature as well as the appearance of any humanoid. Their mind reading ability will be used to help them behave like the person they have replaced."

    "section": "Dragon",
    "text": "Dragon\nDragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish “true” dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven “age categories,” ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.\nIf one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.\nA dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).\nEach dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.\nThe breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.\nThere are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon’s breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a “normal” shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM’s option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three shapes.\nThe shapes are:\nCone Shaped: The breath weapon begins at the dragon’s mouth, and is about 2’ wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon’s type and age).\nLine Shaped: The breath weapon is 5’ wide and extends the given length in a straight line.\nCloud Shaped: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20’ deep or high.\nAll dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of “talking;” this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for “talking” is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.\nSome dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.\nAlthough goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It’s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would have about double the given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no treasure)."

Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad’s oak does not radiate magic. A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.\nA dryad’s delicate features are much like a female elf’s, though her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons. Although they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been encountered in one place on rare occasions.\nShy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are alluring – they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad can charm (as the spell charm person), attempting to gain control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense."

An eagle will also kill and start to eat animals that are 5 times the eagles size, up to 80 lbs. The largest eagles tend to be fish-eating or sea eagles, while other types of eagles will eat snakes or small animals.

However, when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with each eagle choosing a single creature as prey. As they can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more easily choose a victim.\nGiant eagles mate for life. If a nest with eggs or hatchlings is threatened, both parents will fight without checking morale, and other giant eagles in their community may come to their defense but will still seek to scatter any opponents so as to attack them one on one"

Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torchflame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60’, causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit.

    "text": "Elemental*\nAn elemental is a being formed from one of the foundational elements of reality. In Western traditions, the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water; Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. This book presents the full range needed for either tradition, and to those types are added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish to be less traditional. As always, the Game Master decides what sort of monsters appear in their world, and so not all of the following creatures may be encountered.\nEach type of elemental may be summoned to the material plane by means of one of three different methods:\nConjured by the 5th level Magic-User spell conjure elemental; or,\nSummoned by means of a magical staff; or,\nSummoned by a device (as given in the Miscellaneous Magic subsection of the Treasure section of this book.\nThese three types of elementals are quite reasonably called staff, device, and conjured elementals. The hit dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:\n\n\n\nType\nHit Dice\n\n\n\n\nStaff\n8\n\n\nDevice\n12\n\n\nConjured\n16\n\n\n\nThe summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it to control it, and may take no other action, including attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be lost. Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the summoner and attack.\nElementals must be summoned from a large quantity of the appropriate natural material. For example, air elementals require a large quantity of air (so small underground spaces will not support the summoning of one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work). Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other elemental of the same type may be summoned in the same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.\nNon-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental. Attacks made by an elemental should be considered magical for purposes of determining how much damage creatures resistant to the elemental’s attack form should suffer.\nGenerally, elementals are immune to both normal and magical forms of their own attack form. Most are more susceptible to attacks from one or two specific other types of elemental; this is noted in the text for each type."

They are predators, but will normally only attack creatures smaller than themselves. Giant toads are statistically just like giant frogs; however, they are often found in “drier” areas as they do not have to maintain a wet skin surface.\nA giant frog can stretch its tongue out up to 15’ and drag up to dwarf-sized prey to its mouth; on every subsequent round, the victim is hit automatically. On a natural 20 attack roll, the victim is swallowed whole, taking 1d6 damage per round thereafter. Each giant frog can swallow only one such victim."

A ghost normally resembles the form it had in life, but sometimes the spiritual form is altered. For instance, the ghost of someone who believed he or she was evil might look a bit demonic. Because they are incorporeal, ghosts may be hit only by magical weapons.\nSeeing a ghost is so terrible that the victim must save vs. Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. A character or creature who successfully saves vs. a given ghost’s fear attack may not be so affected by that ghost again, but of course may still be affected by another.\nA ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8 points of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same number of hit points. In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit. Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the GM should assign whatever score he or she sees fit.\nLost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of restoration; nothing else (except a wish) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character’s Constitution falls to 0, he or she dies permanently and cannot be raised (but still may be reincarnated).\nOnce per turn, a ghost can use telekinesis (as the spell) as if it were a 10th level Magic-User.\nInstead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living creature. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be able to move into the target (so it is possible to outrun it). The target can resist the attack with a successful save vs. Spells. A creature that successfully saves is immune to being possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the save fails, the ghost enters the target’s body and controls it; control may be maintained until the ghost chooses to leave the victim’s body, or until it is driven out by means of a remove curse spell. While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not use any of its special abilities."

They are vile, disgusting carrion-eaters, but are more than willing to kill for food. Those slain by ghouls will generally be stored until they begin to rot before the ghouls will actually eat them.\nLiving creatures hit by a ghoul’s bite or claw attack must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns. Elves are immune to this paralysis. Ghouls try to attack with surprise whenever possible, striking from behind tombstones or bursting from shallow graves; when they attack in this way, they are able to surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to sleep, charm, and hold magics.\nHumanoids bitten by ghouls may be infected with ghoul fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 5% chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.\nAn afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the knowledge or abilities they possessed in life. The newly-risen ghoul is not under the control of any other ghouls, but hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other ghoul in all respects.\nGhasts look and fight almost exactly like ghouls, but they are smarter and just a bit more powerful. Refer to the previous paragraphs for information about their claw attacks and other abilities.\nThe stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a save vs. Poison or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.\nThey may be Turned by Clerics using the same column as the ghoul, but as they are superior to ghouls, in a mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GM should apply Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.\nHumanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10% chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.\nAn afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a ghast at the next midnight, in a similar fashion to the ghoul. However, a humanoid who becomes a ghast in this way retains all of the knowledge and abilities they possessed in life, unless those abilities are directly incompatible with the creature’s new form (as decided by the GM). For such ghasts, the GM should also adjust XP values to include any such abilities. The newly-risen ghast is not under the control of any other ghasts, but hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other ghast in all respects."

To many, appearance indicates station: The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite). Like most giants, they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand tribute from humans, demi-humans, or humanoids living nearby.\nCloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. Cloud giants can throw large stones up to 200’ for 3d6 points of damage each. Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 8 (2d4). A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells. In battle, cloud giants wear finely crafted, intricately engraved plate mail."

Females are slightly smaller, standing 22 feet tall on the average and weighing around 14,000 pounds. They look very much like enormous, thickly built hill giants, and among humans they are often seen as little more than that. This is underselling the mountain giants, however, for though their crafting is primitive they have an intricately detailed social structure.\nMountain giants live in clans, led by the oldest male and female (or by their oldest offspring if the elders choose to delegate leadership due to advanced age). Each clan rules over and controls a group of 1d6 mountain peaks, generally spanning an area with a 5-6 mile diameter. They prefer peaks connected by high ridges so that they do not have to descend too far when walking their territory. Clan members who are mated establish households within the territory; unmarried members typically live with their parents until they are wed. The “lair” encounter figures above are for a single household, but if one household is attacked and the attackers subsequently retreat, upon their return they will usually find much of the rest of the clan waiting for them in ambush.\nThey wear armor made of wood held together with heavy rope, and wield giant clubs or staves carved from fully grown trees harvested from the lower reaches of their territory. If they live near storm giants, they may trade for better weapons (the second damage rating given above) but usually cannot afford storm giant armor.\nA mountain giant can throw large stones up to 240’ for 4d6 points of damage each"

Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Males usually wear short, carefully trimmed beards.\nGnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years. They have Darkvision with a 30’ range. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20% chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.\nGnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure.\nMost gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the statistics above are for such. In the lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2 on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics and Magic-Users are equivalent to regular gnomish warriors statistically."

    "text": "Golem*\nGolems are a kind of construct, a creature created from non-living matter and animated by application of magic. The powers required to animate a golem are prodigious, and involve summoning, capturing, and binding an elemental spirit to the constructed body. This process also binds the golem to the will of its creator.\nThey are mindless, and thus immune to magics affecting the mind such as sleep, charm, hold, and any form of mind reading or telepathy. They must be given explicit, detailed instructions verbally, and the controller must usually be within 60 feet of the golem to do so. If not actively being commanded, a golem will follow the last instructions given to it until the controller returns. If such a golem is attacked, it will fight in its own defense but will usually not pursue the attackers if they flee. The controller can order the golem to follow the commands of another, but can always resume control if desired (i.e. the controller’s commands always take precedence).\nEmploying a golem in combat is tricky, for once one attacks an opponent there is a cumulative 1% chance each round (so 1% the first round, 2% the second, 3% the third, and so on) that the golem will stop following commands and become berserk. Once this happens the golem will attack any creature in range, choosing targets randomly when there are more than one. If all targets are killed or driven away the golem will move on, looking for more creatures to kill and breaking down any barrier that stands in its way if it is at all possible.\nThe berserk chance for a golem that is still under control is reset to 0% only when the golem is inactive, neither attacking nor being attacked, for one full round.\nThe creator of the golem (but not any other person who might have been delegated control) may try to calm the golem, speaking firmly to it to convince it to stop. The creator needs to succeed at a saving throw vs. Spells to do this, after spending a round talking to the golem. If this roll fails the golem turns its attention to the creator and pursues them with single-minded hatred.\nIf a berserk golem is unable to attack anyone for 5 rounds it resumes its inactive state, and the controller can again give it commands. If it begins to pursue its creator, though, it will never stop no matter how long it takes, and must normally be trapped or destroyed to stop it. It has no special way to find the creator, however, and will become inactive if it loses sight of the creator for a minimum of 1 day. If the golem is successfully calmed, it can be given commands again on the very next round of combat.\nAs their bodies are made of non-living matter, golems can only be hit by magical weapons. Conversely, they are less resistant to various effects due to the fact that they are not living creatures; in general, golems save as if they were Fighters of ½ their hit dice in levels. For example, a Bone Golem has 8 hit dice, but saves as a Fighter of 4th level."

A Griffon will attack a horse over anything else, diving low to swipe with their claws. They are not above retreating and coming back later, when there may be less of a defense mounted.\nGriffons can be trained as mounts if raised in captivity, but even in this case they may try to attack horses if any come within about 120’. Roll a morale check in this case; if the check is failed, the griffon will try to attack immediately. A light load for a griffon is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds."

This breath weapon does 1d6 points of damage per each hit die of the hellhound to all within the area of effect; a successful saving throw vs. Dragon Breath reduces damage to half normal.\nNote that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice each has.

If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round. Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be affected by a sleep spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from the victim(s) due to smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more round."

When attacking or pursuing, the ironbane stands up on its hind legs, but when resting or moving slowly it folds them and walks on all four feet.\nLike the more common rust monster (as found on page 138), the touch of any part of an ironbane’s body transforms metal objects into rust (or verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate). Non-magical metal attacked by an ironbane, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A non- magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons or armor lose one “plus” each time they make contact with the ironbane; this loss is permanent.\nThe metal oxides created by this monster are its food; thus, a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this.\nMetals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to an ironbane and will be ignored. Silver and copper on the other hand are candy for this creature and one will pursue the tastiest-smelling adventurer in any party."

A kobold is 2 to 2½ feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas. They aim to drive enemies into the traps, where other kobolds wait to pour flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin onto them. Kobolds have Darkvision with a range of 60’, and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of light spells. Kobolds typically wear leather armor in battle.\nOne out of every six kobolds will be a warrior of 1 Hit Dice (25 XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP) with an Armor Class of 14 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP) who wears chain mail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 10’, and who has a +1 bonus to damage. In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular kobold statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.\nKobolds are cunning foes. They see all larger races as enemies, and are thus likely to be hostile when encountered. However, they are naturally cowardly, and prefer to avoid combat, leading enemies into ambushes or traps rather than facing them directly. Sometimes kobold tribes build and inhabit extensive dungeon areas filled with deadly traps which only they know how to avoid."

Adult male lions are larger than females, and in most varieties have a prominent mane. They live in social groups called prides consisting of a few adult males, several related females, and their cubs.\nGroups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates; any hunting group of 1 or 2 is 80% likely to be females, and any group of 3 or more almost certainly are. Sometimes male lions are rogues, living outside a pride, and in those cases they may hunt as individuals or in pairs.\nLions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

They wear leather armor and carry shields in battle.\nLizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for an extended period of time (up to a full turn). They cannot swim while wearing armor; however, they often hide in the water even while armored, standing on the bottom with just nose and eyes exposed (similar to a crocodile). When they are able to employ this maneuver, lizard men surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.\nLizard men are largely indifferent to other races, being primarily interested in their own survival. If aroused, however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple but sound tactics.\nSubterranean lizard men, also called troglodytes, are superficially very similar to the common variety. Their skin is paler, and their eyes are red and seem to glow in low light conditions. Individuals are shorter than the common variety, standing just 5 to 6 feet tall, due in part to their somewhat “hunched” stance. They weigh about as much as the common type.\nThese monsters can change color at will, allowing them to blend into underground environments so well that they gain surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6. Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills.\nSubterranean lizard men secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard character races) find the scent repulsive, and those within 10 feet of one must make a saving throw versus poison. Those failing the save suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain within 10 feet of the creature. Getting out of range negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates the penalty without an additional saving throw. The results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after which a new save must be rolled."

The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it unless a save vs. Petrification is made. In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC. It is safe to view a medusa’s reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrification itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.\nFurther, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs. Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).\nA medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human.\nMedusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain. They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can without being discovered."

Also called “sirens,” mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or other men found near the sea. They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.\nA mermaid’s song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid’s temperament.\nContrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.\nMermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.\nThree-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a pod.\nOne-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.\nA mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only in groups of 1 or 2.\nMermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some Clerical abilities."

A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45 pounds.\nTen or more nixies can work together to cast a powerful charm (similar to charm person). The charm lasts one year (unless dispelled). A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. Each nixie can cast water breathing once per day, with a duration of one day. Finally, a group of nixies will often have a school of giant bass living nearby who can be called to their aid (see Fish, Giant Bass for details).\nNixies are fey creatures, and thus unpredictable.

Further, any time a giant octopus hits with at least one tentacle per each 100 pounds of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it; unless the victim can find a way to resist (using whatever method the player might think of and whatever rolls the GM may choose), they will be pulled into the water and thus be in danger of drowning.\nDon’t forget to account for the weight of armor worn! If a giant octopus fails a morale check, it will squirt out a cloud of black “ink” 40’ in diameter and then jet away at twice normal speed for 2d6 rounds.

Rhagodessas have “pedipalps,” an elongated pair of forelegs with sticky pads on them for capturing prey.\nGiant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found in desert terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while those found underground may be black or white in color (those found in the deepest caverns are always white). Like spiders, they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise climb entirely upside down.\nA hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast and will be drawn to the rhagodessa’s mouth on the next round and automatically hit for 2d8 points of damage; this repeats each round, so long as the victim is held. Escaping from the sticky hold requires a successful roll to open doors. If both legs hit, this roll frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa can simply attack again with the free leg on the next round. Alternately, victims may attack with small or medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2 is added to the attack roll if a small weapon is used. If the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in this case another character can help, making the roll for the victim).\nThe rhagodessa seems unable to use its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way, and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim will attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace."

Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. Like most birds, the males have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be hidden, that is).\nA light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1,200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3,000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to 6,000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off full- grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds.\nA roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to be as “fresh” as possible when given to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary).\nWhen rocs are encountered they are almost certainly hunting, and will generally attack creatures of horse size or less. If facing a large group the rocs may make passes close overhead to scatter them first before each chooses a single target to prey upon. Mated pairs found in their nests will fight to the death to protect their eggs or offspring (morale of 12 in this case)."

A rot grub secretes an anesthetic when it bites and will burrow into the flesh. A burrowing grub can be noticed if the victim succeeds at a Wisdom check. If successful, the victim sees strange rippling beneath his skin. If failed, the creature does not notice the grubs. During the first two rounds, a burrowing rot grub can be killed by applying fire to the infested skin or by cutting open the infested skin with any slashing weapon. Either method deals 2d6 points of damage to the victim, but kills the grubs.

One attacks with its antennae, brushing them over metal items. Non- magical metal attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A hit with a non-magical metal weapon inflicts half damage before the weapon is destroyed. Magic weapons or armor permanently lose one “plus” each time they make contact with the monster.\nThe metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this. Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to a rust monster and will be ignored. While rust monsters will consume oxides of silver or copper, they have a strong preference for ferrous metals (iron or steel), preferring them over any other metal.\nWhether the rust monster is in any way related to the rarer ironbane (as found on page 115) is unknown, but both monsters seem to have the exact same power."

Shriekers are found in underground areas such as caverns and dungeons. They are found in a variety of pale colors, most commonly white, gray, lavender, or red.\nThis monster does not attack directly; rather, its shrieking tends to attract the attention of other monsters in the nearby area. Movement or light within 10 feet, or causing any damage to one, will cause one to wail for 1d4 rounds.\nIn game terms, the GM should generally roll a wandering monster check each round that this monster wails."

Their tentacles are studded with barbs and sharp-edged suckers.\nMembers of any group of these creatures encountered are equally likely to be male or female. The GM may roll for this or may assign them as they see fit.\nIn order to bite a creature, the giant squid must hit with at least two tentacles first. Further, any time a giant squid hits with at least one tentacle per each 75 pounds of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it; unless the victim can find a way to resist (using whatever method the player might think of and whatever rolls the GM may choose), they will be pulled into the water and thus be in danger of drowning. Don’t forget to account for the weight of armor worn!\nIf a giant squid fails a morale check, it will squirt out a cloud of black “ink” 30’ in diameter and then jet away at twice normal speed for 3d8 rounds. If a group fails a morale check they will move away in random directions in hopes that at least one will escape any pursuit."

The proboscis has rows of tiny serrated teeth on the inside, and literally turns itself inside out as it carves a way into the victim’s body. This causes 1d4 points of damage, and the stirge then proceeds to suck the victim’s blood, inflicting an additional 1d4 points of damage each round.\nOnce attached, the creature can only be removed by killing it. The victim cannot use weapons larger than a dagger or hand axe to attack the creature, and cannot attack it at all if attacked from behind. Others may attack the creature with a bonus of +2 on the die roll, but any attack that misses hits the victim instead."

They fertilize their soil by entangling, constricting, and killing living creatures, then depositing the bodies in loose soil around the plant’s base.\nBecause it can lie very still indeed, a strangle vine surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.\nStrangle vines are actually mobile, able to uproot themselves and move slowly from place to place; one generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.\nEach plant consists of a single long vine of up to 20 feet in length, with many smaller vines 5 feet or so in length packed closely, two vines per foot or thereabouts. The smaller vines are covered in leaves, and in the fall they bear clusters of reddish-purple berries which are tough and bitter but not poisonous.\nThere is a similar plant found in underground environments which has leaves the color of iron with pale shiny metallic veins. They grow near geothermal vents or springs, and the rotting flesh that surrounds them often supports mushrooms of various sizes and types. This fungal growth conceals the strangle vine, allowing it to surprise on 1-5 on 1d6 as does the above- ground variety of the plant."

No matter how many of a tentacle worm’s attacks hit an opponent in a given round, only one saving throw is required in each such round.\nIf all opponents of a tentacle worm are rendered paralyzed, it will begin to feed upon the paralyzed victims, doing 1 point of damage every 1d8 rounds until the victim is dead; if other paralyzed victims are still alive, the worm is 50% likely to move on immediately to another still-living victim.

Many treants know Elvish, and some who live near humans learn Common as well.\nTreants are slow to act when potential enemies are nearby, preferring watch them carefully before taking any action. Because of their excellent camouflage treants gain surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.\nAll treants have the power to animate other normal trees in their area; up to two trees can be animated at once, but the treant can release one and animate another if needed. Trees to be animated must be within 180 feet of the treant, and must remain within that range or they will return to their normal state. An animated tree requires a full round to uproot itself before it can move around, and then can move at a rate of just 10’ per round. Of course, if enemies are within reach the animated tree need not be uprooted. If the treant controlling an animated tree is slain or incapacitated, the tree returns to its normal state.\nAny character or creature nearby when this happens must save vs. Death Ray to scamper away; those who fail will suffer 2d6 points of damage and will be trapped under the fallen tree. The GM should consider battlefield conditions when deciding on the exact results of such an event."

They stand up to 9 feet tall despite having a rather hunched posture, and may weigh as much as 600 pounds. Their skin is rubbery and slightly damp to the touch, and they have long sharp black claws and long sharp white teeth. Trolls have a disconcerting tendency to smile toothily most of the time, as if their brutal lives are the most entertaining thing imaginable.\nTrolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of damage each round after being injured. A troll reduced to 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point. Note that the troll may “play dead” until it has regenerated further. Damage from fire and acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces attackers armed with fire or acid.\nThe regenerative power of trolls is so great that limbs or other body parts (even a head!) can be reattached if severed simply by pressing the severed ends back together for a moment. Trolls in a group will generally help dismembered fellows to reassemble themselves, but only if it’s convenient. If the severed part is not restored, a new one will grow in its place in 1d4 turns.\nNote that a troll with a new head will not remember its former life, nor will it yet know how to speak; it will behave as would any confused and hostile animal.\nTrolls speak a primitive language, and are often fluent in Goblin, Hobgoblin, Orc, Ogre, or Giant depending on which of these species live nearest them. A few (20% or so) speak Common.\nTrolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed. Though trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and claws.\nA trollwife is a female troll; despite the name, there is no requirement that she be married (nor, in fact, do trolls normally engage in formal marriages). A typical adult trollwife stands 11 feet tall and weighs 700 pounds. They have no outward appearance of femininity, at least according to the standards of humans, elves, or even orcs; rather, a trollwife simply looks like an extraordinarily large troll. Like a normal male troll, a trollwife has lumpy skin that is a dull grayish green in color.\nTrollwives have all the abilities and weaknesses of the males of the species; in particular, they regenerate exactly as do the males.\nWhen encountered, a trollwife may be alone, cohabitating with a male (her “husband”), or raising a brood of trollkin. Roll 1d10; on a result of 1, she is living alone; on a roll of 2-3, she is raising her young; on 4 or higher, she is living with a male. If one has a mate or offspring, there is a 1-3 on 1d10 chance she is encountered alone, 4-7 that her mate or young are encountered in her absence, or 8-10 that all are present.\nAdd 1 to the trollwife’s morale score if she is with her mate, or 2 if she has young present. This means that, unless threatened with fire or acid, a trollwife will fight without checking morale while her offspring are present. If a trollwife’s mate or offspring are slain in her absence, she will track the killers unerringly, and upon finding them will attack with the same morale bonus.\nTrollwives are solitary with respect to other adult trollwives, for they hate each other with a fierce passion. If forced together they will put aside their enmity until all non-troll enemies are dead (at which point they may well fight over who will eat the choicest of the remains)."

They have all the powers and weaknesses of trolls, and look exactly like smaller than normal adult trolls. Even an infant has the same ability to regenerate as an adult troll.\nWhen you encounter trollkin, you can rest assured that there is a trollwife nearby (unless, of course, you’ve already slain her). They are as bloodthirsty as their parents; as such, determining the number appearing is done in a particularly unusual fashion:\nRoll 1d6 for the number of individuals, and 2d6 for the number of hit dice. Divide the number of hit dice by the number of individuals to arrive at the hit dice of each individual. Note that a trollkin won’t be encountered having more than 6 hit dice, so if only one individual is indicated by the 1d6 roll but the 2d6 roll totals more than 6, you must increase the number of individuals. The referee should feel free to round the number of hit dice up or down as they see fit, or to allocate them in an approximately equal fashion if desired. Trollkin broods are rolled in this way owing to the fact that bigger or tougher individuals are likely to kill and eat the weaker ones, generally when their mother is out hunting.\nRefer to the entry for trolls for details regarding regeneration, morale checks, and so on; except as noted above, trollkins share all these features with the adults"

A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.\nUnicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.\nThree times per day a unicorn can cast cure light wounds by a touch of its horn. Once per day a unicorn can transport itself 360’ (as the spell dimension door), and can carry a full load (possibly including a rider) while doing so. A light load for a unicorn is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.\nAn Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid stronger parties.\nAlicorns cannot heal or transport themselves by magic as unicorns do. However, alicorns may become invisible at will, exactly as if wearing a ring of invisibility."

Like hobgoblins, urgoblins wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields into battle, blending in perfectly.\nSome hobgoblin tribes consider urgoblins an abomination, and kill them whenever they can be identified. Other hobgoblin tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord them great honor. There are even rumors of a tribe entirely made up of urgoblins, with kidnapped hobgoblin females as their mates; reportedly they slit the throats of all infants born to their mates, so that only those who have the power of regeneration survive."

Though they may look just a bit more pale than when they were alive, they do appear to live and even breathe as mortals do. A vampire has all the memories and abilities it had in life, and is effectively immortal. Living forever in the shadows often leads to vampires being decadent, while their hunger for blood makes them cruel.\nVampires cast no reflections in silvered mirrors or water, though despite conventional wisdom to the contrary they do reflect in shiny base metals; the innate purity of silver and water simply will not reflect them. A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs. Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by the vampire.\nThe bite inflicts 1d3 points of damage, then each round thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates (i.e. is healed) for up to 1d6 hit points for each energy level drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, they will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later) and thereafter will be under the complete control of the “parent” vampire (but is freed if that vampire is ever destroyed).\nIf using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and thus a vampire will generally choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite.\nVampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.\nCreatures of the night obey vampires. Once per day a vampire can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby). The creatures summoned arrive 2d6 rounds later and will obey the vampire for up to an hour before leaving.\nVampires can also transform into the form of these creatures, assuming the shape of a giant bat (page 66), giant rat (page 135), or a dire wolf (page 158) at will. The transformation requires a single round during which the vampire cannot attack. The flying movement given above is for the giant bat form; the vampire can use the attack forms of the animal shape assumed, as given on the indicated pages. The vampire cannot activate any of its other powers while in animal form, but effects already active will remain so.\nVampires are powerful indeed, but they do have several specific weaknesses.\nFirst, a vampire can be held at bay by several things, including the smell of garlic, a silver or silvered mirror, or a holy symbol presented by a believer (GM’s discretion is advised here, but in general someone threatened by a vampire may be more devout than usual). In such a situation the vampire cannot approach within 5 feet of the repellent item or character, nor can it make any melee attacks or otherwise touch those within the warded area.\nRunning water (such as a stream or river) acts as a barrier to a vampire; one cannot cross over any such waterway, neither by bridge or by waterway or even by flying. It is possible for a vampire to be carried across while lying in its own coffin with the lid closed; the presence of the water flowing beneath the coffin will force the vampire to remain dormant.\nFinally, a vampire may not enter any private dwelling without being invited by someone who resides there, and then only if invited while the resident is actually inside the structure. Public buildings of any sort do not present this problem; even inns are fully accessible to a vampire.\nDestroying a vampire is not an easy task. When reduced to zero hit points or less a vampire becomes incapacitated but is not slain (as previously explained). If exposed to direct sunlight, the vampire will be utterly destroyed in a single round if it cannot find a way to escape in that time. Being immersed in running water (as defined above) causes 3d8 points of damage each round, and if reduced to zero or fewer hit points in this way the vampire is destroyed. If the vampire is cremated in a funeral pyre while in any dormant state it will be destroyed.\nThe most dramatic method of defeating a vampire is actually the least reliable: driving a wooden stake through its heart. Doing this will instantly reduce the vampire to zero hit points, and it will remain “dead” for so long as the stake is present. Removal of the stake, however, allows the vampire to begin regenerating as described above. It is not normally possible to drive a stake through a vampire’s heart while it is actively resisting, but this can be done after reducing the monster to zero hit points in the usual way. Of course, after staking a vampire it is possible to use sunlight, running water, or a funeral pyre as described above to complete its destruction."

They eat noisily.\nThese creatures are found in fresh and salt water as well as in swamps.

Once a giant weasel bites a living creature, it hangs on, rending with its teeth each round until the victim or the weasel is dead, or until the weasel fails a morale check (rolled normally) in which case it will let go of its victim and flee.\nThere are many varieties of normal-sized weasel, including several which are called ferrets; in some territories, the giant weasel is thus called a giant ferret. The only distinction is that those which are tamed are always called ferrets, though not all giant ferrets are tame. Various humanoid races as well as some fairy creatures are known to tame giant ferrets for use as guards or war-animals."

A wyvern’s body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton. They are built more like bats than lizards, having two legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have four legs and two wings.\nWyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.\nWyverns attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, clawing at its opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. Any living creature hit by the wyvern’s stinger must save vs. Poison or die. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack or when landing.\nIf a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry off its victim; only victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most 6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it may be dropped."

It takes only half damage from edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical bonus). It can be Turned by a Cleric (as a zombie), and is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. A skeletaire never fails morale, and thus always fights until destroyed.\nThe statistics above are for a skeletaire formed from a 2nd-level Magic-user. A skeletaire will have HD equal to the character’s level minus 1, and will save as a Magic-user of the level equal to its HD. The skeletaire cannot speak, but still retains the ability to prepare and cast spells as it did in life (but like a zombraire, it cannot learn new spells).\nThe process of creating or becoming a zombraire are variable, and often involve cursed magic items (especially cursed scrolls)."

It is up to the Game Master to decide how much treasure he or she wishes to allow into the campaign. Too much gold (or other treasure which can be converted to gold) may make things too easy for the player characters. Similarly, too many magic items may also make things too easy.\nIf you are a novice Game Master, remember that you can always give more treasure, but it can be difficult to drain treasure from the party without angering the players… particularly if you use heavy-handed methods. Start small, and work up as you gain experience."

    "section": "Explanation of Magic Items",
    "text": "Explanation of Magic Items\n\nUsing Magic Items\nTo use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly.\nMany items are activated just by using them. For instance, a character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, wear a ring, or don a cloak. Activation of these items is generally straightforward and self-explanatory. This doesn’t mean that if you use such an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such as from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.\nIf no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.\nA command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Note that many magic items must be held in the hand (or otherwise specially handled or worn) to be used; the risk of accidental activation is less significant for such items.\nLearning the command word for an item may be easy (sometimes the word is actually inscribed on the item) or it may be difficult, requiring the services of a powerful wizard or sage, or some other means of discovery.\nOnly the character holding or wearing a magic item may activate it. A character who has been gagged or silenced may not activate a magic item which requires a command word.\nWhen an article of magic armor, clothing or jewelry (including a ring) is discovered, size is not usually an issue. Such items magically adjust themselves for wearers from as small as Halflings to as large as Humans. This effect is called accommodation. The GM may create “primitive” items lacking this power if he or she wishes.\nGenerally only one magical item of a given type may be worn at the same time. For example, a character can normally only wear one suit of armor, wear one necklace and carry one shield at a time. In the case of rings, a character may wear one magical ring per hand. If a character wears more items of a given type than would normally be practical, the items will usually fail to function due to interference with one another; for instance, wearing two rings on the same hand normally results in both rings failing to operate. Note, however, that this limitation cannot be used to disable cursed magic items. For example, wearing a cursed ring would prevent another magic ring from being worn and used on that hand, but the curse would not be lifted by donning a second magic ring.\n\n\nMagic Weapons\nMagic weapons are created with a variety of powers and will usually aid the wielder in combat. A magical weapon’s bonus is applied to all attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.\nCasts Light on Command: By drawing the weapon and uttering a command word, the wielder may cause it to glow; it will then shed light with the same radius as a light spell. Sheathing or laying down the weapon, or speaking the command word again, dispels the effect. This power may be used as often as desired.\nCharm Person: This power allows the wielder to cast charm person once per day, as if by an 8th level Magic-User, by brandishing the weapon, speaking a command word and gazing at the target creature. (The wielder’s gaze does not have to be met for the spell to be cast.) The target creature is allowed saving throws just as described in the spell description.\nDrains Energy: A weapon with this power drains one life energy level on a hit, as described under Energy Drain in the Encounter section; up to 2d4 levels can be drained by a weapon with this power, after which time the weapon loses this power but retains any other magical effects or bonuses.\nFlames on Command: Upon command, the weapon will be sheathed in fire. The fire does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until the command is given again, or until the weapon is dropped or sheathed. While it flames, all damage done by the weapon is treated as fire damage, and an additional +1 bonus (in addition to the weapon’s normal bonus) is added to damage when fighting trolls, treants, and other creatures especially vulnerable to fire. It casts light and burns just as if it were a torch.\nLocate Objects: This power allows the wielder to cast the spell locate object once per day, as if by an 8th level Magic-User.\nSpecial Enemy: These weapons are created to combat a specific sort of creature, as rolled on the Special Ability table. When used against that specific enemy, the second listed bonus applies instead of the first; so a sword +1, +3 vs. Undead would provide +1 attack and damage against giant rats, but +3 attack and damage rolls against zombies.\nWishes: Weapons with this power have the ability to grant 1d4 wishes. The GM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are given in the Game Master section regarding this. After these wishes have been made, the weapon loses this power, but retains any other bonuses and powers.\nCursed Weapons inflict a penalty to the wielder’s attack rolls, as rolled on the Weapon Bonus table. The curse causes the afflicted character to be unable to get rid of the weapon. There are two possible forms the curse may take: Obsession and Affliction. The GM may decide which to use at his or her option.\nObsession: Regardless of how severe the penalty is, the character wielding the weapon will believe it is a bonus and refuse to use any other weapon in combat. A remove curse spell is the only way to rid a character of such a weapon; but as he or she will believe the weapon is the best magical weapon ever, the character receives a saving throw vs. Spells to resist.\nAffliction: The character knows the weapon is cursed as soon as he or she uses it in combat; however, any attempt to throw it away fails, as the weapon magically appears back in the character’s hand whenever he or she tries to draw any other weapon. In this case, the remove curse spell needed to rid the character of the weapon will be unopposed (i.e. no saving throw).\n\n\nMagic Armor\nMagic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical protection to the wearer. In general, magic armor grants the normal Armor Class for its type, plus the magical armor bonus, as rolled on the Magic Armor table; for example, Plate Mail +2 provides an Armor Class of 19.\nThere are two varieties of cursed armor: Cursed Armor -1 and Cursed Armor AC 11. The first variety’s AC is reduced by the rolled penalty; for example, Plate Mail -1 grants Armor Class 16. The second type is much worse, for regardless of the type, it only provides Armor Class 11. Dexterity and shield bonuses still apply.\nCursed armor cannot be removed from the wearer once the curse is proven, that is, once the wearer is hit in combat. Once the curse has taken effect, only a remove curse spell, or some more powerful magic (such as a wish), will enable the wearer to remove it. The armor will detect as magical, like any other magic armor; the curse cannot be detected by any means other than wearing the armor in combat.\n\n\nPotions\nA potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker. Unless otherwise noted, a potion grants its benefits for 1d6+6 turns (even if the duration of an associated spell is longer or shorter).\nClairaudience: This potion enables the drinker to hear sounds in another area through the ears of a living creature in that area, up to a maximum 60’ away. This effect otherwise functions just as the spell clairvoyance.\nClairvoyance: This potion grants the imbiber the effect of the clairvoyancespell.\nCold Resistance: This potion grants the imbiber the power of the spell resist cold.\nControl Animal: This potion functions like a control human potion, but affects only normal, non-magical animals.\nControl Dragon: This potion functions like a control human potion, but affects only dragons.\nControl Giant: This potion functions like a control human potion, but affects only giants.\nControl Human: This potion allows the drinker to charm a human, demi-human, or humanoid by gazing at them. The effect functions like the charm person spell. If the charm is resisted, the drinker can attempt to charm up to two more targets before the potion’s benefit is exhausted.\nControl Plant: This potion grants the drinker control over one or more plants or plant creatures within a 10’ square area up to 50’ away. Normal plants become animated, having a movement rate of 10’, and obey the drinker’s commands. If ordered to attack, only the largest plants can do any real harm, attacking with a +0 attack bonus and inflicting 1d4 points of damage per hit. Affected plant creatures (who fail to save vs. Spells) can understand the drinker, and behave as if under a charm monster spell.\nControl Undead: This potion grants the drinker command of 3d6 hit dice of undead monsters. A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Mindless undead follow the drinker’s commands exactly; free-willed undead act as if under a charm person spell.\nDelusion: This cursed potion will appear, if tested or analyzed, to be one of the other potions (other than poison). When imbibed, the drinker will briefly believe he has received the benefits of the “other” potion, but the illusion will be swiftly exposed…\nDiminution: This potion reduces the drinker and all items worn or carried to one-twelfth of his or her original height (so that a 6’ tall character becomes 6” tall). The drinker’s weight is divided by 1,728; this makes an armed warrior weigh less than 2.5 ounces. The affected creature cannot make an effective attack against any creature bigger than a house cat, but may be able to slip under doors or into cracks and has a 90% chance of moving about undetected (both in terms of sound and vision).\nFire Resistance: This potion grants the imbiber the power of the spell resist fire.\nFlying: This spell grants the power of the spell fly.\nGaseous Form: The drinker and all of his or her gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. He or she becomes immune to non-magical weapons, and has an Armor Class of 22 vs. magical weapons. The imbiber can’t attack or cast spells while in gaseous form. The drinker also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of 10’, and can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, as long as the potion persists. The gaseous creature is subject to the effects of wind, and can’t enter water or other liquid. Objects cannot be manipulated in this form, even those brought along when the potion was imbibed. The drinker cannot resume material form at will, but must wait for the potion to expire; however, the potion may be quaffed in thirds, in which case each drink lasts 1d4+1 turns.\nGiant Strength: This potion grants the imbiber the Strength of a giant. For the duration, the drinker gains a bonus of +5 on attack and damage rolls with melee or thrown weapons, and can throw large stones just as a stone giant can.\nGrowth: The drinker of this potion (with all equipment worn or carried) becomes twice normal height and eight times normal weight. The enlarged character is treated as having the Strength of a Stone Giant (but without the rock-throwing ability), gaining +5 on attack and damage rolls.\nHealing: The imbiber of this potion receives 1d6+1 hit points of healing (as the spell cure light wounds).\nHeroism: This potion improves the fighting ability of the drinker. Fighters of less than 3rd level gain +3 to attack bonus as well as gaining 3 hit dice. Fighters of 4th to 5th level gain +2 to attack bonus and 2 hit dice. Fighters of 6th or 7th level gain +1 to attack bonus and 1 hit die. Fighters of 8th level or higher, as well as non-Fighter class characters, gain no hit dice, but still receive +1 to attack bonus. Hit dice gained are only temporary, and damage received is deducted from those hit dice first; any that remain when the potion expires are simply lost.\nInvisibility: This potion makes the imbiber invisible (as the spell). This potion may be quaffed in thirds, in which case each drink lasts 1d4+1 turns.\nInvulnerability: This potion grants a bonus of +2 to Armor Class.\nLevitation: This potion grants the power of the spell levitate.\nLongevity: The drinker of this potion becomes younger by 1d10 years.\nMind Reading: This potion grants the power of the spell of the same name.\nPoison: This isn’t a potion at all, it’s a trap. The drinker must save vs. Poison or die, even if only a sip was imbibed.\nPolymorph Self: This potion grants the power of the spell of the same name.\nSpeed: This potion gives the drinker the benefits of the spell haste.\nTreasure Finding: The imbiber of this potion will immediately know the direction and approximate distance to the largest treasure hoard in a 300’ spherical radius. This potion specifically detects platinum, gold, electrum, silver, and copper; gemstones and magic items are not detected.\n\n\nScrolls\nMost scrolls contain some sort of magic which is activated when read, and which may only be used once; the characters burn away as the words are read.\nSpell Scrolls are enchanted with one or more Cleric or Magic-User spells (never both sorts on the same scroll). Each spell can be used just once, though of course the same spell may appear multiple times on a single scroll. Use the table below to determine the spell level of each spell on a scroll. Only a Cleric can use a Clerical scroll, and only a Magic-User can use a Magic-User scroll.\nMagic-Users must cast read magic on a spell scroll before being able to use it; each scroll needs to be treated in this way just once, and the effect lasts indefinitely thereafter. If a Magic-User attempts to cast a spell from a scroll, and he or she does not know that spell, there is a 10% chance the spell will fail. If a spell on a scroll is of higher level than the highest level spell the Magic-User can cast, for each spell level of difference, add 10% to the chance of failure. For example, Aura the 3rd level Magic-User attempts to cast polymorph self from a scroll. Aura is able to cast, at most, 2nd level spells. Polymorph self is a 4th level spell, so Aura has a chance of failure of 10% (she doesn’t know the spell) plus 20% (2nd level maximum vs. 4th level spell), for a total of 30%.\nClerical scrolls are written in a normal language (being just specially enchanted prayers), so the Cleric merely needs to know the language in which the scroll is written in order to use it. Clerics suffer the same chance of failure as do Magic-Users, save that the 10% penalty assigned for not knowing the spell does not apply.\n\nSpell Scrolls: Spell Level\n\n\n\nd%\nLevel of Spell\n\n\n\n\n01-30\n1st\n\n\n31-55\n2nd\n\n\n56-75\n3rd\n\n\n76-88\n4th\n\n\n89-97\n5th\n\n\n98-00\n6th\n\n\n\nA Cursed Scroll inflicts some curse upon whoever reads it. It need not be read completely; in fact, merely glancing at the text is enough to inflict the curse. A saving throw may or may not be allowed, as determined by the GM (though a save vs. Spells should usually be allowed). The GM is encouraged to be creative when creating curses; the spell bestow curse (the reverse of remove curse) can be used for inspiration, but cursed scrolls can contain more powerful or inventive curses at the GM’s discretion.\nProtection Scrolls can be read by any character class, assuming the character can read the language the scroll is written in (see the notes under Language in the Character section for details). When read, a protection scroll creates a 10’ radius protective circle around the reader; preventing the warded creatures from entering. The circle moves with the reader. Any creature other than the sort the scroll wards may enter, including of course the allies of the scroll-reader, who are themselves protected so long as they remain entirely within the circle. If any creature within the circle performs a melee attack against any of the warded creatures, the circle is broken and the warded creatures may freely attack. Normal protection scrolls last for 2 turns after being read.\nProtection from Magic scrolls are special, as they protect against magic spells and items rather than creatures. No magical effect can cross the 10’ circle of protection in either direction for 1d4 turns. As with the other protection scrolls, the circle created by this scroll moves with the reader.\nTreasure Maps are generally non-magical. They must be created by the GM, although he or she may delay creating the map until the characters can actually use it. The treasure indicated on the map will normally be guarded by some sort of monster, determined by the GM as desired.\n\n\n\nRings\nA ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than one ring per hand) that has a spell-like power (often a constant effect that affects the wearer).\nControl Animal: The wearer of this ring can charm up to 6 hit dice of animals. The effect works much like a charm person spell, but only affects animals (including giant-sized animals, but excluding fantastic creatures as well as anything more intelligent than a dog or cat). The wearer can activate the power at will, targeting any animal within 60’ that he or she can see. The wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to “free” enough hit dice to control a new target.\nControl Human: The wearer of this ring may cast the spell charm person at any target he or she can see within 60’. The wearer can use this power once per round, at will, but cannot control more than 6 hit dice of creatures at a time; however, the wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to “free” enough hit dice to control a new target.\nControl Plant: The wearer of this ring may create an effect equivalent to a potion of plant control at will, affecting plants or plant creatures within 60’ that he or she can see. The effect lasts as long as the wearer remains within 60’ of the plants or plant creatures. A saving throw is allowed just as for the potion.\nDelusion: This ring appears to be some other sort of ring (roll again on the rings table to determine what sort). Whoever wears it believes it is working, and behaves thus (so a character who believes he is wearing a ring of invisibility will believe himself to actually be invisible). Unlike the potion of the same name, the ring’s effect is not dispelled by the wearer taking damage; in fact, the only way to rid a character of this cursed item is with the spell remove curse.\nDjinni Summoning: This ring serves as a special gate by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed, the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes non-magical and worthless.\nFire Resistance: The wearer of this ring receives protection as the spell resist fire, but the protection works continually.\nInvisibility: By activating this simple silver ring, the wearer can benefit from invisibility, as the spell. If the invisibility is dispelled (as described for the spell), the ring may not be reactivated for one full turn. The invisibility effect otherwise lasts for 24 hours.\nProtection: This ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a bonus to the Armor Class of the wearer (varying from +1 to +3 as shown on the table). This bonus is also applied to the wearer’s saving throw die rolls.\nRegeneration: This ring grants the wearer the power of regeneration, exactly as described in the description of the troll, including the weakness with respect to acid and fire damage. However, only damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated.\nSpell Storing: A ring of spell storing contains a number of Magic-User spells that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. Any class may wear and use this ring, but it can only be recharged by a Magic-User casting the appropriate spell into it. A table is provided below to determine how many spells, and what levels they are. A ring of spell storing must be recharged with the same spells that were placed into it when it was made; so a ring of two spell storing containing fireball and fly can only be recharged with those two spells. The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells stored within it. A ring found in a treasure hoard may be completely charged, or discharged, or partially charged, at the GM’s option.\n\n\n\nd%\n# of Spells\nd%\nLevel of Spell\n\n\n\n\n01-24\n1\n01-30\n1st\n\n\n25-48\n2\n31-55\n2nd\n\n\n49-67\n3\n56-75\n3rd\n\n\n68-81\n4\n76-85\n4th\n\n\n82-91\n5\n86-97\n5th\n\n\n92-96\n6\n98-00\n6th\n\n\n97-00\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Turning: This ring reflects spells cast directly at the wearer, but not area effect spells, back at the caster; so a hold person spell would be reflected, but not a fireball. It will reflect up to 2d6 spells before its power is exhausted.\nTelekinesis: The wearer of this ring can use the power of the spell telekinesis, as if cast by a 12th level Magic-User. The effect may be used as many times per day as the wearer wishes, but lasts only as long as the wearer concentrates on it.\nWater Walking: This ring allows the wearer to walk on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the wearer’s feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Molten lava will still cause the wearer damage from the heat since he or she is still near it. The wearer can walk, run, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.\nWeakness: Whoever puts this ring on is cursed; his or her Strength score is reduced immediately to 3. The ring can only be removed with remove curse.\nWishes: A ring of wishes contains the power to grant wishes to the wearer. 1d4 wishes will remain within the ring when it is found. The GM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are given in the Game Master section regarding this.\nX-Ray Vision: On command, this ring gives its possessor the ability to see into and through solid matter. Vision range is 20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead or gold blocks the vision. The ring may be used three times per day, and each use lasts at most one turn (or until the wearer ceases to concentrate upon it).\n\n\nWands, Staves and Rods\nA wand is a short stick, generally 12 to 18 inches long, imbued with the power to cast a specific spell or spell-like effect. A newly created wand has 20 charges, and each use of the wand depletes one of those charges; a wand found in a treasure hoard will have 2d10 charges remaining. If a wand generates an effect equivalent to a spell, assume the spell functions as if cast by a 6th level caster, or the lowest level caster who could cast that spell (whichever is higher), unless otherwise noted. Wands are generally usable only by Magic-Users. Saving throws are rolled as normal, but on the Magic Wands column rather than the Spells column.\nA staff has a number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created staff has 30 charges, and each use of the staff depletes one or more of those charges. A staff found in a treasure hoard will have 3d10 charges remaining. Spell effects generated by a staff operate at 8th level, or the lowest caster level the spell could be cast by, whichever is higher, unless otherwise stated. Staves are usable only by Magic-Users, except where noted. Saving throws against magic from a staff are rolled on the Spells column.\nA rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell. Rods are normally usable by any class.\nRod of Cancellation: This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. If the item is held by a creature, an attack roll is needed to touch it. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by a wish.\nSnake Staff: This item is a walking staff +1. When used by a Cleric, the user may command the staff to transform into a constrictor snake (instead of causing damage) on a successful hit. The snake will wrap around a target up to man sized and hold him or her fast for 1d4 turns, unless a save vs. Spells is made. The snake does not attack in any other way, nor cause any damage. The snake may be recalled by the user at any point, in which case it returns to his or her hand and returns to staff form. It also returns in this way when the duration expires, or if the save is made. The snake has Armor Class 15, moves 20’ per round and has 20 hit points; any hit points of damage taken are healed completely when the snake returns to staff form; if killed in snake form, the magic is destroyed and it turns into a broken stick. The staff may be used any number of times per day, and neither has nor uses charges.\nStaff of Commanding: This staff can cast charm person and charm monster spells, and can grant a power equivalent to a potion of plant control. Each function uses one charge.\nStaff of Healing: This staff can heal 1d6+1 hit points per charge expended, as the spell cure light wounds. Alternately, with an expenditure of two charges, the staff can cast cure disease. This staff is only usable by a Cleric.\nStaff of Power: This is a very potent magic item, with offensive and defensive abilities. It is usually topped with a glistening gem, its shaft straight and smooth. It has the following powers costing one charge per use: lightning bolt(6d6 damage), fireball (6d6 damage), cone of cold (as the wand, for 6d6 damage), continual light, and telekinesis (as the ring, lasting at most 1d6 turns). The staff is also a +2 walking staff, and can be used exactly as a staff of striking. A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30’ radius, doing 1d6 damage per charge remaining (save vs. Spells for half damage). All within the area, including the wielder, are affected by this.\nAfter all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 walking staff. Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.\nStaff of Striking: This staff has no attack bonus, but is treated as a +1 weapon with respect to what sorts of monsters it can hit (and is usable by any class in that mode). This staff’s primary power may only be used if wielded by a Cleric: By uttering a command word, the Cleric may create an effect similar to the spell striking. Expenditure of one charge adds 1d6 damage to the weapon’s next strike; expenditure of two charges adds 2d6, and expenditure of three charges adds 3d6 damage. If the weapon is not successfully used after the command word has been spoken, the effect dissipates after one turn.\nStaff of Wizardry: This staff is equivalent to the staff of power, above, and has the following powers as well: invisibility, passwall, web, and conjure elementals (as the spell, but conjuring staff elementals as described in the Monsters section). These powers each use one charge when activated.\nWand of Cold: This wand generates a conical blast of cold doing 6d8 damage (save vs. Magic Wands for half damage). The cone spreads from the tip of the wand to a width of 30’ at a distance of 40’ away.\nWand of Enemy Detection: The effect of this wand is to make all enemies of the user within 60’ glow with a greenish white light for one round. Even hidden or invisible enemies glow in this way, revealing them, but enemies completely out of sight (such as behind a wall) may not be seen by the user. An “enemy” is any creature which is thinking of or otherwise intending to harm the user; also, all undead monsters and animated constructs within range will glow in this way regardless of intent or thoughts (or lack thereof).\nWand of Fear: This wand generates the effect of the spell cause fear (the reverse of the spell remove fear).\nWand of Fireballs: This wand generates fireballs, exactly as the spell, doing 6d6 damage.\nWand of Illusion: This wand allows the user to create illusions equivalent to the spell phantasmal force.\nWand of Lightning Bolts: This wand generates lightning bolts, exactly as the spell, doing 6d6 damage.\nWand of Magic Detection: This wand grants the user a power equivalent to the spell detect magic.\nWand of Paralyzation: This wand creates the effect of the spell hold person.\nWand of Polymorph: This wand can be used to cast either polymorph self or polymorph other.\nWand of Secret Door Detection: This wand grants the user a power similar to the spell find traps, but which reveals secret doors rather than traps.\nWand of Trap Detection: This wand grants the user a power equivalent to the spell find traps.\n\n\nMiscellaneous Items\nThese items may take any of several forms, and have a variety of effects; when randomly rolled, the effect is determined first (as explained with the tables above) and then the form is rolled on a separate table. Generally, such an item is written as a [Form] of [Effect], for example, a Cloak of Fire Resistance.\nItems with forms meant to be worn are limited in that only a normal number may be used at one time: at most two rings (one on each hand), one cloak, a pair of boots, one helm, and one pendant. If a character is wearing two items that grant the same continuous effect, such as Cold Resistance or Protection, only one such item will function. If the items have differing levels of effect, such as a Cloak of Protection +1 and a Ring of Protection +3, only the more powerful item will operate (in this case, the ring).\nWhile the tables on page 167 provide standard forms for miscellaneous items, the Game Master is in no way limited to what appears on the Form of Item table; items may be created with forms not normally allowed there, or indeed even in forms that are not there at all.\n\n\nMiscellaneous Item Effects\nBlasting: When this device is played (as appropriate for its form), it creates a powerful blast of sound filling a cone 10’ long and 2’ wide at the base. Those within the area of effect suffer 2d6 points of damage and are deafened for 1 full turn. A successful saving throw vs. Death Ray reduces damage by half and reduces the period of deafness to a single round.\nThe device can also be used to damage or destroy buildings, fortifications, etc. Double the damage listed above when this item is used against a structure. The Stronghold rules in the Game Master section contains further guidance on this.\nBlending: The wearer of this item becomes nearly invisible, granting an 80% chance that the wearer can move about unnoticed. If detected by onlookers, the wearer can be attacked without significant penalty.\nCold Resistance: The wearer of this device receives protection as the spell resist cold, but the protection works continually.\nComprehension: The wearer of this device is granted the ability to read any language, including any form of magical script. Being able to read magic does not confer magical abilities upon the wearer, but if worn by a magic-user it grants the effects of read magic constantly. Note that when reading non-magical texts, the limitations described under the spell read languages apply to this device also.\nControl Animal: The wearer of this device can charm up to 6 hit dice of animals. The effect works much like a charm person spell, but only affects animals (including giant-sized animals, but excluding fantastic creatures as well as anything more intelligent than a dog or cat). The wearer can activate the power at will, targeting any animal within 60’ that they can see. The wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to “free” enough hit dice to control a new target.\nControl Human: The wearer of this device may cast the spell charm person at any target they can see within 60’. The wearer can use this power once per round, at will. If more than one humanoid is to be affected, the wearer cannot control more than 6 hit dice or levels of humanoids at a time; however, the wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled creatures at any time, in order to “free” enough hit dice or levels to control a new target.\nControl Plant: The wearer of this device may create an effect equivalent to a Potion of Plant Control at will, affecting plants or plant creatures within 60’ that they can see. The effect lasts as long as the wearer remains within 60’ of the plants or plant creatures. A saving throw is allowed just as for the potion.\nCourage: When this device is played, all characters and creatures friendly to the user within 60 feet are affected as by the spell remove fear.\nDeception: This device grants to the wearer the power of the Deceiver (as described on page 75). Any attacker will believe the wearer is 3 feet from their true location, and the attacker’s first strike will always miss. Thereafter, the attacker suffers a penalty of -2 on all attack rolls. This ring does not affect mindless creatures, constructs such as golems or living statues, or any sort of undead. Living creatures which are not mindless will be affected even if they do not use sight to target the wearer.\nDelusion: Whoever wears this device believes it is some other form of useful magical device, and behaves thus (so for example, if Darion believes he is wearing a Ring of Invisibility he will believe himself to actually be invisible). Unlike the potion of the same name, the device’s effect is not dispelled by the wearer suffering damage; in fact, the only way to rid a character of this cursed item is with the spell remove curse.\nDjinni Summoning: Each device of this type has a specific djinni bound to it, which will be summoned to the wearer’s location when they rub the device while wearing it. The djinni appears in the next round and protects, serves, and obeys the wearer. The djinni will serve at most 1 hour per day, and can be summoned at most once per day. If the djinni bound to a device is ever slain, the ring loses all magical properties.\nDoom: When this device is played (as appropriate for its form), this device will create animated skeletons or zombies as if by the spell animate dead. Up to 3d6 hit dice of undead monsters will be so created from remains within a 60’ radius of the character who activated the device. If both skeletal and fleshy remains are available in the area of effect, skeletons will be animated in preference over zombies. If the user is a magic-user or cleric, the created undead may be controlled so long as that character retains the device. If played by a fighter or thief, the undead created will be uncontrolled, and will attack any living creatures nearby. The device may be used once per day, but no more than 18 hit dice of undead created by it may exist at any one time.\nFire Resistance: The wearer of this device receives protection as the spell resist fire, but the protection works continually.\nInvisibility: The wearer of this device can become invisible (as the spell invisibility) on command. If the invisibility is dispelled (as described for the spell), the device may not be reactivated for one full turn. The invisibility effect otherwise lasts for 24 hours. Levitation: The wearer of this device may levitate (as the spell) at will by concentrating. There is no limit to how long this device may be used.\nMind Reading: Whoever wears this device has access to a permanent form of the spell mind reading; it is always available but only activates when the wearer spends a full round concentrating upon it, and persists until the wearer ceases to use it. The effect can be activated as many times per day as the wearer wants.\nPanic: When this device is played (as appropriate for its form), all creatures more than 20 feet from the user but not over 120 feet away must save vs. Spells or be affected as by the spell cause fear.\nPenetrating Vision: On command, and for so long thereafter that the wearer concentrates on it, this device confers the power to see through solid matter as if it were transparent as glass. The effect extends at most 20 feet, and the wearer sees as if in normal light even if they are in fact in total darkness.\nThis effect is blocked by certain materials; the wearer can see through at most 3 feet of wood or soil, 1 foot of stone, or 1 inch of most metals. Gold or lead no thicker than foil will completely block the effect.\nThe device may be used three times per day, and each use lasts at most one turn.\nProtection: The wearer of an item with this power receives the listed benefit (from +1 to +3) to their Armor Class for so long as the ring is worn. This bonus is also applied to the wearer’s saving throw die rolls.\nProtection from Energy Drain: This device has the power to absorb and neutralize energy-draining attacks, death spells or effects (such as slay living), and curses that would otherwise affect the wearer. The device has 2d6 charges when found, and each negative level, curse, or spell absorbed consumes one charge. When the device’s charges are exhausted it disintegrates into golden sparkles and disappears.\nProtection from Scrying: The wearer of this item is immune to all forms of scrying (including crystal balls, clairvoyance, clairaudience, and any other means of location or spying at a distance) as well as any form of mind reading. Other characters who are within 30’ of the wearer are also immune to scrying, but not to mind reading\nRegeneration: This device grants the wearer the power of regeneration, exactly as described in the description of the Troll on page 151, including the weakness with respect to acid and fire damage. Note that this device will only heal damage suffered while it is worn; pre-existing damage is not healed by putting on the device.\nScrying: This device can be used to spy upon other people or locations, regardless of distance. A scrying device may only be used by Magic-Users. It can be used three times per day, for up to a turn each time. The chance of success when using a scrying device is as shown below. Total chances equal to or greater than 100% do not require a roll.\n\n\n\nKnowledge and Connection\nChance\n\n\n\n\nSecondhand Knowledge (heard of)\n25%\n\n\nFirsthand Knowledge (seen briefly)\n55%\n\n\nFamiliar (known well)\n95%\n\n\nPossession or garment\n+25%\n\n\nBody part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.\n+50%\n\n\n\nThe user of the device is the only one who will see the image. No sound will be heard normally. Detect magic, detect evil, and mind reading have a 3% chance per level of the caster of operating correctly if used with a scrying device.\nScrying, Superior: This item works exactly like a standard scrying device, as described above, but also allows the user to hear any sounds in the location viewed as if they were there.\nSpeed: The wearer of this device can activate it with a command word (or by clicking their heels together, if the item takes the form of boots) and gain the effect of a haste spell, and can end the effect the same way. The effect can be used for a total of 10 rounds each day.\nSpell Storing: These much sought-after devices each contain a number of spells which can be cast by the wearer. Most of them contain Magic-User spells, but 1 in 10 contains Clerical spells instead. No device may contain spells of both types! Each spell stored in the device is cast as if by the lowest-level character who could normally cast the spell, but not less than 6th level in any case.\nAny class may wear and use this device, but it can only be recharged by casting the appropriate spell into it. A table is provided below to determine how many spells, and what levels they are. A spell storing device must be recharged with the same spells that were placed into it when it was made; so a Pendant of Two Spell Storing containing fireball and fly can only be recharged with those two spells.\nThe wearer of one of these devices automatically knows the names of the spells stored within it, but is not granted detailed knowledge of how each spell works. If the wearer is not a magic-user and no such character is available to advise the wearer, there may be some difficulty in using it successfully (and safely).\nA device of this type found in a treasure hoard may be completely charged, or discharged, or partially charged, at the GM’s option.\n\n\n\nd%\nno of Spells\nd%\nLevel of Spell\n\n\n\n\n01-24\n1\n01-30\n1st\n\n\n25-48\n2\n31-55\n2nd\n\n\n49-67\n3\n56-75\n3rd\n\n\n68-81\n4\n76-85\n4th\n\n\n82-91\n5\n86-97\n5th\n\n\n92-96\n6\n98-00\n6th\n\n\n97-00\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Turning: This device reflects spells cast directly at the wearer, but not area effect spells, back at the caster; so a hold person spell would be reflected, but not a fireball. It will reflect up to 2d6 spells before its power is exhausted.\nStealth: The wearer of this device can move quietly in virtually any surroundings, granting a 90% chance of success when moving silently (as the Thief ability of the same name).\nTelekinesis: The wearer of this device can use the power of the spell telekinesis, as if cast by a 12th level Magic-User. The effect may be used as many times per day as the wearer wishes, but lasts only as long as the wearer concentrates on it.\nTelepathy: Three times per day this item can be activated by use of its command word, at which point it will grant the wearer the power of a special version of the mind reading spell which has a range of 90 feet and lasts for 1 turn. During this time the wearer can send thoughts to the mind of any creature whose thoughts the wearer is already reading, allowing communication.\nTeleportation: Upon command the wearer of this item may cast the spell teleportation as if by a wizard of the 12th level of ability. This power can be used up to 3 times per day.\nTrue Seeing: Three times per day this device can grant the user the power of the spell true seeing. Each use lasts at most one turn.\nWater Walking: This device allows the wearer to walk on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the wearer’s feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Molten lava will still cause the wearer damage from the heat since they are still near it. The wearer can walk, run, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.\nWeakness: Whoever puts this device on is cursed; their Strength score is reduced immediately to 3. The device can only be removed with remove curse.\nWishes: This device contains the power to grant wishes to the wearer. 1d4 wishes will remain within the ring when it is found. The GM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are given in the Game Master section regarding this.\n\n\nRare Items\nBag of Devouring: This device appears, to all tests, to be a normal Bag of Holding, and in fact it performs exactly like one at first. However, all items placed within disappear forever 1d6+6 turns later. The bag continues to weigh whatever it did after the items were placed within it (that is, one-tenth the total weight of the items), until it is opened and discovered to be empty.\nBag of Holding: This device is a bag which appears to be about 2 feet wide and 4 feet deep. It opens into an extradimensional space, and is able to hold more than should be possible: up to 500 pounds of weight, and up to 70 cubic feet of volume. The bag weighs one-tenth as much as the total of the objects held within. Any object to be stored in the bag must fit through the opening, which has a circumference of 4 feet.\nPuncturing or tearing the bag will destroy its magic and cause all contents to be lost forever. If this item is turned inside out all contents are dumped. The bag is unharmed, but it will no longer work until it is turned right side out again. If living creatures are placed inside they will suffocate within a turn (with exceptions for creatures resistant to suffocation as determined by the GM). The bag’s volume cannot be overfilled (as excess items simply cannot be put inside), but if overloaded above 500 pounds and then lifted it will be torn.\nGetting any particular item from the bag requires the bearer to spend a round searching during which no movement may be made.\nBoots of Traveling and Leaping: These boots allow the wearer to make great leaps, jumping up to 10’ high and/or 30’ across. They improve the wearer’s movement so greatly that they also increase their movement rate on land by an additional 10’ per round.\nBroom of Flying: This broom is able to fly through the air for up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as they have a good idea of the location and layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when the command word is spoken.\nEfreeti Bottle: This item may appear as an ornate bottle, or sometimes as a magic lamp. It can be activated once per day, by opening it if it takes the form of a bottle or by rubbing it if it takes the form of a lamp. When activated, smoke pours out and forms into an efreeti.\nThe efreeti released was trapped in the bottle and forced to serve whoever activates it. However, an efreeti who has spent too long in a bottle may have lost its mind, and if this happens the efreeti will begin a frenzied attack upon whoever activated the bottle, disappearing when either the user of the bottle or the efreeti is dead. There is, fortunately, only a 1 in 10 chance this will happen.\nOn the other hand, there is also a 1 in 10 chance that the efreeti of the bottle is able to grant three wishes to the user. If this is the case, the efreeti will perform no other service, and cannot return to the bottle after it is activated until the user makes a wish. Subsequent wishes require additional activations, and upon the final wish being granted the efreeti disappears for good.\nRoll 1d10 when the bottle is first activated; on a roll of 1, the efreeti is insane, while on a roll of 0 the efreeti has three wishes to grant. If neither of these results is rolled, the efreeti will serve the user for up to one hour per day for 101 days, after which time it is freed and will disappear. Note that after the first activation, every day that passes is counted toward the 101 days whether or not the user activates the bottle.\nFlying Carpet: This item appears to be a fancy rug of the sort found in the castle of a king. It has the power to fly, carrying those upon it as if they stand upon a solid surface. A flying carpet is typically 5’ x 8’ in size and can carry up to 500 pounds at a movement rate of 100’ per round, or up to 1,000 pounds (its maximum capacity) at a rate of 50’ per round. A flying carpet can fly at any speed up to its maximum, and can hover on command.\nGauntlets of Ogre Power: These thick leather gloves grant the wearer a Strength bonus of +4 (instead of their own Strength bonus). Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be effective.\nGirdle of Giant Strength: This broad leather belt grants the wearer the strength of a giant. For so long as it is worn, the wearer gains a Strength bonus of +5 (instead of their own Strength bonus), and can throw large stones just as a stone giant does.\nMirror of Imprisonment: This item can appear as any style of full-length or larger mirror. It is a form of magical trap, which can be set or deactivated by speaking a command word followed by “activate” or “deactivate.”\nWhen in its active state, any character or creature who stands within 30 feet of the mirror and sees its reflection must save vs. Spells or be drawn bodily into the mirror, including all items worn or carried. The victim is placed within one of 20 metaphysical cells inside the mirror. Those trapped in the mirror are mere reflections and are unable to take any action. The last character who spoke the command word to the mirror is immune to its power, as are undead, constructs, and any creature that lacks eyes.\nA character who speaks the command word and then calls the number of a cell will cause the reflection of the occupant of that cell to appear in the mirror. The trapped creature can move and speak, but cannot cast spells or take any other real action. The controlling character may interrogate the trapped victim if desired, though the mirror does not compel the victim to respond or to be truthful. The controller may at any time speak the command word again and say “return” and the victim will be returned to its cell; or, the controller can say the command word followed by “come out” to free the victim, who appears standing beside the controller.\nShould all cells be full when a creature is drawn inside, one cell chosen at random will be emptied with the freed creature appearing where the trapped one had been standing. The freed creature is safe from the mirror for one turn thereafter before it can again be trapped. All victims will be freed instantly if the mirror is broken.\nRope of Climbing: This 50 foot long rope is about ½ inch in diameter, but is capable of supporting up to 3,000 pounds if tied to a secure anchor point. When the user holds one end of the rope and speaks the command word, the rope animates, moving like a snake at a rate of 10’ per round in whatever direction the user commands. The rope is even able to move into a completely vertical position if so ordered. It can be commanded to tie itself to any anchor point within reach (since the user must continue holding one end of the rope, it can reach no more than 50 feet from that point). The rope has no real strength and thus cannot lift or support any weight if not tied to an anchor point.\n\n\nDevices for Summoning Elementals\nThese devices all grant the power to summon and control an elemental. As noted, the GM is likely to choose to allow only certain types of Elementals, so not all of these devices may be available in your campaign.\nWhen one of these devices is activated in accordance with the summoning rules described for the Elemental monster entry on page 88, an appropriate elemental appears and follows the summoner’s commands.\nBowl of Summoning Water Elementals: This device is about the size of a punch bowl, and will be made of precious metals set with jewels. To activate this device, it must be filled with fresh water (at least a quart) and the command words inscribed around its rim must be spoken, which requires a full round to complete.\nBrazier of Summoning Fire Elementals: This device appears to be a small brazier, a metal bowl with legs and cage-like sides which stands about a 1½ feet tall. Braziers are meant to hold fire. To activate this device, a fire must be built in this brazier and the command words inscribed around its rim-band must be spoken, which requires a full round to complete.\nCenser of Summoning Air Elementals: This device appears to be an ornate but ordinary censer, a kind of bowl with a perforated lid and a chain which is used to lift and swing the device. These are normally used in worship, but this device is made for a different purpose. To activate this device, incense must be placed in the bowl, lit, and covered, and the command words inscribed around the edge of the lid must be spoken, which requires a full round to complete.\nCrucible of Summoning Metal Elementals: This device appears to be a small crucible, an open-topped vessel used for melting metal. To activate this device, it must be placed on a solid, adequately heat-resistant surface and the command words inscribed around the edge of the lid must be spoken, which requires a full round to complete.\nThe crucible becomes very hot while the metal elemental is present, causing 2d8 points of damage to any character who dares to touch it barehanded and 2d6 points even if wearing armor or ordinary fabric or leather gloves. The crucible requires a full turn to cool after use.\nMallet of Summoning Wood Elementals: This is a wooden mallet of the sort used by builders to drive in pegs; though it could be used as a weapon, it is a poor excuse for one as it does just 1d4 points of damage on a hit and is not treated as a magic weapon. To activate this device, it must be held in the hand and the command words inscribed on one side of the hammer- head must then be spoken, which requires a full round to complete.\nMarble Plate of Summoning Cold Elementals: This device is a circular plate of marble about 9 inches in diameter and about ¾ of an inch thick. To activate this device, it must be placed level on a solid, stable surface and a full skin of fresh water must be poured upon it; as the water touches the base it magically freezes into a small sculpture of a cold elemental. The command words inscribed around the rim of the plate must then be spoken, which requires a full round to complete.\nRod of Summoning Lightning Elementals: This device appears as a copper rod about ¾ inch thick and 2 feet long, tipped with a polished ball of amber. The rod will have a smooth, polished green surface (a thin coating of verdigris) but will not be pitted or damaged by the corrosion. To activate this device it must be held in the hand and the command words inscribed on the length of the rod must then be spoken, which requires a full round to complete.\nStone of Summoning Earth Elementals: This device is a roughly-cut but highly-polished stone in which a vein or cluster of precious or semi-precious stones is visible. To activate this device, it must be held in the user’s hands and the command words inscribed on the smoothest area of the stone must be spoken, which requires a full round to complete."

Without further delay we moved out, intent upon reaching the stairs to the surface and then returning to Morgansfort. But it couldn’t be that easy…\nOn the way in, Barthal scouted ahead and we took our time, constantly on the lookout for monsters. On the way out, we threw caution to the wind, moving at full speed with Barthal watching behind us. So it was that Morningstar and I turned a corner and practically stepped on the first rank of a goblin patrol!\nOnce again I was caught flatfooted, but so were the goblins. Morningstar reacted more swiftly, striking down the first of the little monsters. You might think that parley would have been a better idea, but we had already tried that with these goblins without success… so I couldn’t blame the Elf for striking first and asking questions later.\nI raised the golden sword and waded into battle…"

    "section": "City, Town or Village Encounters",
    "text": "City, Town or Village Encounters\nIt’s important for the Game Master to remember that, unlike dungeon or wilderness environments, cities, towns and villages are busy places. During the day, most towns will have people on the streets more or less all the time; the absence of people on the streets is often an indication of something interesting. By night, much of the town will be dark and quiet, and encounters will be mostly Thieves or other unsavory types; but near popular eating (or drinking) establishments, people of all sorts are still likely to be encountered. The GM must make sure that his or her descriptions of the town environment make this clear; of course, this will also make it harder for the players to identify “real” encounters.\nThe GM is encouraged to create his or her own encounter tables for use in each city, town or village created (or assign encounters by other means if desired); however, a set of “generic” encounter tables are provided below for those times when such preparation has not been completed. Roll 2d6 on the table below to determine what sort of encounter occurs; a description of each type of encounter appears below the table.\n\nInputs.button(\"Roll on Table\", \n{value: 0, \nreduce: () =&gt; highlightTableRow(\"#city-encounters\", \ngeneralTableSelect([2,6,0],[[ 2 , 2 ],[ 3 , 3 ],[ 4 , 4 ],[ 5 , 5 ],[ 6 , 6 ],[ 7 , 7 ],[ 8 , 8 ],[ 9 , 9 ],[ 10, 10],[ 11, 11],[ 12, 12]]))})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2d6)\nDay Encounter\nNight Encounter\n\n\n\n\n2\nDoppleganger\nDoppleganger\n\n\n3\nNoble\nShadow*\n\n\n4\nThief\nPress Gang\n\n\n5\nBully\nBeggar\n\n\n6\nCity Watch\nThief\n\n\n7\nMerchant\nBully\n\n\n8\nBeggar\nMerchant\n\n\n9\nPriest\nGiant Rat\n\n\n10\nMercenary\nCity Watch\n\n\n11\nWizard\nWizard\n\n\n12\nLycanthrope, Wererat*\nLycanthrope, Wererat*\n\n\n\n\nBeggar encounters will often begin with a single beggar approaching the party, but there will generally be 2d4 beggars in the area, and if any party member gives anything to the first beggar, the others will descend on the party like flies. Each beggar is 90% likely to be a normal man, and 10% likely to be a 1st level Thief, possibly scouting for the Thieves Guild or a local gang.\nBully encounters will be with 2d4 young toughs; each is 70% likely to be a normal man, 30% likely to be a 1st level Fighter. Bullies generally appear unarmed, depending on their brawling ability in a fight (but keeping a dagger or shortsword hidden, to be used in case the fight is going against them). Bullies can be a bit unpredictable, such that the GM may want to use a reaction roll to determine the leader’s mood.\nCity Watch encounters will be with 2d6 watchmen, all 1st level Fighters save for the squad leader, who will be from 2nd through 4th level. They will confront “suspicious-looking” characters, but generally will need a good reason before they attempt to arrest or otherwise interfere with player characters.\nDoppleganger encounters will, of course, appear to be some other type of encounter; the GM should roll again to determine what the doppleganger is masquerading as. 1d6 dopplegangers will be encountered; any extra group members will be humans who do not know they are traveling in the company of shapeshifting monsters. If the party is “interesting” to the dopplegangers, one or more of the monsters will attempt to follow them and replace a party member (as described in the monster description). In many cases, player character parties will not discover the true nature of the encounter until much later.\nGiant Rat encounters will generally involve alleys, the docks, or other “low” places. Rats are generally not dangerous unless provoked, but if surprised they may attack. See the monster description for details of this encounter type.\nLycanthrope, Wererat encounters will appear to be some other type of encounter, either another sort of “normal” encounter or a giant rat encounter (depending on the circumstances). Wererats are cowardly and will not attack a party of equal or larger size.\nMercenary encounters will involve 2d6 members of a mercenary company, going about some business or other. A mercenary leader may offer a position to Fighter-classed player characters if they have any reputation at all.\nMerchants are a common feature of towns, and may be encountered performing any sort of business. As with mercenary encounters, merchants may offer jobs to interesting player characters, particularly those with good reputations. See Creating an NPC Party, below, for details on this type of encounter. (A merchant in a town may not have a full entourage as described below; the GM should use his or her discretion in creating the encounter.)\nNobles encountered may also offer positions to player characters, or possibly offer a reward for some dangerous task. Player characters with bad reputations may be confronted, ordered to leave town, or even arrested if the noble is able to call for the city watch. (See Creating an NPC Party, below, for details on this type of encounter.) A noble in a town may not have a full entourage as described below; the GM should use his or her discretion in creating the encounter.\nPress Gangs will consist of 2d6 Fighters, all 1st level except for one or two leaders of 2nd through 5th level. They will be armed with blunt weapons or possibly will fight with their bare hands, since their goal is to capture rather than kill player characters; however, it is likely that at least some members of a press gang will have daggers or swords on their persons in case a serious fight breaks out. A press gang will not confront a party of equal or greater size unless the party is obviously weakened, drunk, etc. If the party loses, they will awaken aboard a ship at sea or in a military camp (depending on whether sailors or soldiers captured them), unarmed and at the mercy of their captors.\nPriest encounters will usually be similar to a group of pilgrims (see Creating an NPC Party, below, for details), though the group encountered will not be as large as would be encountered in the wilderness. Generally, a single priest of 1st through 4th level will be encountered, accompanied by 1d4 of the faithful.\nShadow encounters in a town will be much like the same encounter underground; see the monster description for details.\nThief encounters will be with a group of 1d6 Thieves, generally disguised as ordinary townsmen or sometimes as beggars. One Thief in the group will be from 2nd to 4th level, with the others being 1st level only. They will seek to steal from the party, of course, unless watched very carefully.\nWizard encounters will involve a Magic-User of 4th through 7th level, accompanied by 1d4-1 apprentices of 1st level. The GM must decide on the temperament and mood of the wizard."

    "section": "Creating An NPC Party",
    "text": "Creating An NPC Party\n\nAdventurers\nA party of NPC adventurers will usually consist of 4-8 characters, as follows: 1d3 Fighters, 1d2 Thieves, 1d2 Clerics, and 1d2-1 Magic-Users. Usually the characters will all be of similar levels; after deciding what average level the party should be, you may wish to make a few of the characters lower levels (to reflect the usual “replacements” brought in when some characters die).\nThe Game Master must choose the race(s) of the NPC adventurers to suit the region they are found in (or come from). Probably 80% or more of adventurers are Human, 10% are Dwarves, 6% are Halfling and the remaining 4% Elvish. If the NPC adventurer party is evil, the GM may choose to replace some party members with humanoid monsters such as orcs, hobgoblins, or gnolls.\nThe party may be rivals with the player characters, vying for the same treasures, or they may actually be enemies, evil marauders that the player characters must defeat. It is, of course, possible that the NPC adventurers are allied or otherwise friendly with the player characters, but this may make things too easy for the players.\n\n\nBandits, Brigands, and Highwaymen\nA party of bandits will generally consist of 2d12 1st level Fighters and 1d6 1st level Thieves, led by a Fighter or Thief of 2nd to 5th level (1d4+1) or by one of each class (if there are 11 or more 1st level members total). In the wilderness, bandits will generally have horses or other steeds appropriate to the terrain (stolen, of course) as well as light armor, swords and bows or crossbows. Determine magic items as given below for the leaders only; rank-and-file members will not normally have magic items.\nIn their lair or hideout, a party of bandits will generally have type A treasure (with magic items omitted since they will have already been generated using the rules below).\n\n\nBuccaneers and Pirates\nThe difference between buccaneers and pirates is largely a question of what they wish to be called; whatever you call them, they are waterborne equivalents of bandits, attacking other ships or raiding coastal towns for plunder.\nA buccaneer party will consist of 3d8 1st level Fighters, led by a Fighter of 3rd to 6th level (1d4+2) and 1d3 Fighters of 2nd to 5th level. All will be experienced at handling ships, of course. They will be unarmored or armored only in leather, and will be armed with swords and bows or crossbows.\nSeagoing pirates may appear in larger numbers, but the number of leader-types will be similar to that given above. Generate magic items for leaders only as described below. A shipload of pirates or buccaneers will have a type A treasure, with magic items omitted (since magic items will already have been rolled for the NPCs); the treasure may not be aboard the ship, however, as pirates often prefer to bury their treasures on islands. In such a case, the Captain or one of his mates will have a treasure map leading to the location of the treasure.\n\n\nMerchants\nMerchants must often transport their wares through wilderness areas. Roughly half of the time (50%), a land-bound merchant party will be led by a single wealthy merchant; other merchant parties will consist of 1d4+1 less wealthy merchants who have banded together for their own safety. There will be 2d4 wagons (but at least one per merchant) drawn by horses or mules. Each wagon is driven by a teamster who is a normal man, usually unarmored and armed with a dagger or shortsword. The caravan will employ 1d4+2 first-level Fighters and 1d4 second-level Fighters as guards.\nIf encountered at sea, a merchant party will generally consist of a single ship owned or rented by a single merchant. The ship will have a crew of 2d8+8 regular crewmen, who are normal men, unarmored and armed with clubs, daggers or shortswords; the Captain, First Mate, and other officers are taken from this number. Large ships may require larger crews. 1d4+2 first-level Fighters and 1d4 second-level Fighters will be aboard as guards, just as with a caravan.\nBesides the valuable but undoubtedly bulky trade goods transported by the merchant caravan or ship, such a party will also have a type A treasure, with magic items omitted; it may be in one chest, or spread out among the wagons.\n\n\nNobles\nA noble party will consist of a noble (of course), possibly accompanied by a spouse (also a noble, of course) and/or one or more children. Each adult noble will have at least one attendant (assistant, lady-in-waiting, etc.).\nLower-ranking nobles (such as barons) will have a single wagon or carriage, drawn by fine horses; higher-ranking nobles will have two or more wagons. The noble may be mounted on a warhorse, though he or she may choose to ride in a carriage part of the time. Each carriage or wagon will have a teamster, who in this case will be a 1st level Fighter in chainmail with a longsword. At least two mounted Fighters of 1st through 4th level will be with the noble as guards; again, higher ranking nobles will have more guards. Guards will generally be armed with longswords and possibly lances, armored in platemail, and their warhorses will usually be barded with chainmail. Determining the exact number of guards is left to the GM in this case. The normal chances for magic items apply, of course.\nA noble will usually be traveling with a little spending money; a type A treasure should be rolled to represent this. In this case, do not omit the magic items, as nobles will generally be more wealthy than the average party of men.\nNobles are usually (70%) normal men; otherwise, roll 1d10: 1-6 indicates a Fighter, 7-8 indicates a Magic-User, 9 indicates a Cleric, and 10 indicates a Thief. (Clerical “nobles” are bishops, archbishops, and the like.) Roll 2d4-1 for the level of each “classed” noble.\n\n\nPilgrims\nA party of pilgrims is on its way to (or from) a major religious locale or activity. Such a party will be led by a 1d4 Clerics of level 1-4 (roll for each).\nThe remainder of the party is rather random in nature; most pilgrim groups include 3d6 normal men (or women if the religion allows women to go on pilgrimages), 1d6 Fighters of level 1-4 (roll for each) with chainmail and longsword, and 1d4 Thieves of level 1-4 (each of whom may be a genuine devout person, or possibly just on the lam). There is also a 50% chance of a single Magic-User of level 1-4 being with the party.\nPilgrims usually travel light, carrying a single bag each and walking or riding mules or horses. The pilgrim party will most likely be bringing offerings of some sort to their destination; generate a type A treasure for this purpose. If magic items are indicated, they will most likely not be used by any of the NPCs as they have already been dedicated to the god or pantheon.\n\n\nMagic Items for NPCs\nNPCs will generally have magic items in proportion to their class and level; assume a 5% chance per level that any given Fighter, Thief or Cleric NPC will have a magic weapon or magic armor (roll for weapon and armor separately for each NPC). Regardless of level, a roll of 96-00 should be considered a failure. Magic-Users will have a Ring of Protection (roll the bonus as usual for the item) on a roll of 4% per level, and a magic dagger or walking staff on a roll of 3% per level.\nIn addition, assume a 2% per level chance that any given character will have a potion, and 3% per level that a Cleric or Magic-User will have a scroll of some sort.\nFinally, add up the levels of all members of the party, and use this number as a percentage chance that a Miscellaneous Magic item will be found among them. If the roll is made, divide the number by two and roll again; if the second roll is made, two such items are found. If the party has more than 3 members, you might wish to divide the number in half again and roll for a third such item. Assign the Miscellaneous Magic item or items to whichever party members seem most appropriate, or roll randomly if you can’t decide.\n\n\nDemi-Human Parties\nIt is assumed above that NPC parties will be Human, or predominantly so; but the Game Master may choose to present parties of Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings from time to time. In general, a party of demi-humans will be homogeneous…. an Elf party would consist of all Elves, for instance. If encountered in the territory of another race, the demi-human party might include a guide hired to lead them to their destination. For example, the Elf party mentioned above might hire a Human guide to help them when traveling through a Human country.\nThe Game Master may simply use the figures given above when generating such parties. One thing that the GM must decide is whether or not the “normal men” rules apply to demi-humans… are there “normal elves” for instance? This decision is left to the GM. If there are such characters, they will have the same racial abilities as others of their race, but will fight with an Attack Bonus of +0 just as normal men do. If there are no such characters in the campaign world, then simply substitute 1st level Fighters for the normal men listed above."

    "title": "20  Managing Encounters",
    "section": "Dealing with Players",
    "text": "Dealing with Players\n\nCharacter Creation Options\nThe standard character creation rules call for rolling 3d6 for each Ability Score in order. Players may complain that they can’t create the sort of characters they want to play. Here are several options you may choose from if you wish to make things easier for your players. Note that the players must not be allowed to demand these options; it’s purely the decision of the Game Master.\nPoint Swapping: Allow the player to “move” points from one Ability Score to another, at a rate of -2 to one score for each +1 added to the other. The maximum score is still 18 (or the racial maximum if lower), and the player should not be allowed to lower any score below 9.\nScore Swapping: Let the player exchange any two Ability Scores, once per character.\nThe Full Shuffle: Let the player arrange the six Ability Score values as he or she wishes. This allows the most customization for the player, but on the other hand you may find that all player characters in your campaign begin to look very much alike. It’s not uncommon for players to “dump” the lowest statistic in Charisma, for instance.\n\n\nHopeless Characters\nSometimes a player will roll for ability scores, look at the ability scores rolled, and declare the character “hopeless.” Of course, no player can be required to play a character with less than 9 in the first four scores, since all four classes would be unavailable to that character. However, you as the Game Master might choose to allow the player to reroll a character with scores that are overall below average even if the character isn’t as “hopeless” as this.\nHere’s an alternate suggestion: Allow the player to “flip” all of their scores by subtracting them from 21. This will turn a roll of 15 (+1 bonus) into a 6 (-1 penalty) but turn a roll of 3 (-3 penalty) into an 18 (+3 bonus). This will result in a character who previously had mostly penalties becoming one with mostly bonuses. If this is allowed, all scores must be flipped, not just the bad ones! Doing this ensures the character is playable while still allowing the possibility of some penalty scores.\nIt is of course possible to roll all average scores, such that the character has neither bonuses nor penalties and would not gain any benefit from flipping scores. The choice here should be the player’s; if they wish to reroll all scores, the GM should probably allow it.\n\n\nAcquisition of Spells\nClerics have an obvious advantage over Magic-Users, in that, in theory, they have access to any spell of any level which they can cast. However, note that Clerics are limited in their spell selection based on their deity, faith or ethos; for instance, a Cleric of the goddess of healing should not be surprised that their deity refuses to grant reversed healing spells. If a Cleric prays for a spell that is not allowed, the Game Master may choose to grant the character a different spell, or optionally (if the deity is angered) no spell at all for that “slot.”\nMagic-Users begin play knowing two spells, read magic plus one other (unless the GM grants more starting spells). Each time the character gains a level, they gain the ability to cast more spells; in addition, every other level the Magic-User gains access to the next higher level spells (until all levels are available). However, gaining the ability to cast these spells does not necessarily mean the Magic-User instantly learns new spells.\nMagic-Users may learn spells by being taught by another Magic-User, or by studying another Magic- User’s spellbook. If being taught, a spell can be learned in a single day; researching another Magic-User’s spellbook takes one day per spell level. In either case, the spell learned must be transcribed into the Magic- User’s own spellbook, at a cost of 500 gp per spell level transcribed.\nA Magic-User may add a new spell of any level they may cast at any point; however, spells of higher levels may not be learned or added to the Magic-User’s spellbook. The Magic-User must find a teacher or acquire a reference work (such as another Magic-User’s spellbook) in order to learn new spells, and the cost of such is in addition to the costs given above. Often a Magic-User will maintain a relationship with their original master, who will teach the character new spells either for free or in return for services. Sometimes two Magic-Users will agree to exchange known spells. In many cases the only option available to a Magic-User will be to pay another Magic-User (often an NPC) anywhere from 100 gp to 1000 gp per spell level in return for such training.\nMagic-Users may also create entirely new spells (or alter existing spells); see the Magic Research rules, below, for details.\n\n\nWeapon and Armor Restrictions\nSeveral races and classes have weapon and/or armor restrictions applied to them. What happens when a player declares that his or her character is going to use a prohibited weapon or wear prohibited armor?\nClerics: The prohibition against edged weapons is a matter of faith for Clerics. Therefore, if a Cleric uses a prohibited weapon, he or she immediately loses access to his or her spells as well as the power to Turn the Undead. A higher-level NPC Cleric of the same faith must assign some quest to the miscreant which must be completed in order for the fallen Cleric to atone and regain his or her powers. If unrepentant, the character is changed permanently from a Cleric to a Fighter. Refigure the character’s level, applying the current XP total to the Fighter table to determine this. Hit points and attack bonus remain the same; change the attack bonus only after a new level is gained as a Fighter, and roll Fighter hit dice as normal when levels are gained.\nMagic-Users: These characters are simply untrained in any weapon other than those normally allowed to them, and should suffer a -5 attack penalty when using any prohibited weapon. A Magic-User in armor can’t cast spells at all; any such attempt fails, and the spell is lost.\nThieves: Wearing armor heavier, more restrictive and/or noisier than leather armor prevents the use of any Thief ability, including the Sneak Attack ability. Thieves may choose to wear such armor, but this only makes them a poor excuse for a Fighter.\nDwarves and Halflings: These characters are prohibited from using large weapons, mainly due to their small stature and relatively low weight. It’s hard to swing a weapon when the weapon is trying to swing you. If such a character tries to use a prohibited weapon, the Game Master may either apply a -5 attack penalty based on the difficulty of using the weapon, or alternately declare the attempt unsuccessful, at his or her option.\n\n\nJudging Wishes\nWishes are one of the most potentially unbalancing things in the game. With a carefully worded wish, a player character can make sweeping, dramatic changes in the game world, possibly even rewriting history. Before allowing the player characters in your game access to even one wish, think about how you will deal with it.\nWishes are granted by a variety of beings. Even when a wish comes from a device (a ring or a sword, for instance), some extradimensional being, god or devil or whatever, has placed that wish in the device. A wish will tend to further the goals of the granting being; if the granter is an evil efreeti, for instance, it will attempt to twist the meaning or intent of the wish so that it does not really accomplish what the player character wants. On the other hand, if the granter is one of the good powers, it will grant the wish as intended so long at the player character isn’t being greedy or spiteful.\nGame balance is the main issue that must be considered. Using a wish to heal the entire party, teleport everyone without error to a distant location, or to avoid or redo a catastrophic battle, is reasonable. A wish that a character be restored to life and health is reasonable, but a wish that not only restores but also improves the character is not.\nIn general, a wish is granted with at least literal accuracy… the words of the wish must be fulfilled. The exception is wishes that are unreasonable for game balance purposes; they are still at least literally interpreted, but may be only partially granted. In the last example above, for instance, the granting power would likely restore the character to life and health but ignore the “improvements” wished for."

    "title": "20  Managing Encounters",
    "section": "Optional Rules",
    "text": "Optional Rules\n\nDeath and Dying\nThe rules state that, at zero hit points, the character is dead. If this is too harsh for you, here are several approaches to changing the situation:\nRaise Dead: The first approach doesn’t change the rules a bit. Arrange matters so that characters killed in an adventure can be easily raised (but at a substantial cost). This not only “deals” with the mortality issue, it also soaks up excess treasure, preventing the player characters from becoming too rich to be interested in adventuring. It also tends to reward the cautious (since they get to keep their gold more often).\nWhat if the characters don’t have enough money when they die to afford to be raised? Allow the local religious establishment to raise dead adventurers in return for their indenture… that is, the adventurers, upon being restored to life, owe the church or temple the money it would have cost to be raised, or an equivalent service. Thus, the local religious leaders would have a ready pool of adventurers to undertake dangerous missions for them.\nBut the adventurer(s) are dead… how can they agree to the indenture? There are two options: the priests can use speak with dead to attain agreement, or the adventurers can sign an agreement with the church before leaving on the potentially dangerous adventure. The latter might even be considered a standard procedure in some places.\nSave vs. Death: The first actual rule alteration is to allow characters reduced to zero hit points to save vs. Death Ray to avoid death. If the save is failed, the character is immediately dead, just as in the normal rules. If the save is made, the character remains alive for 2d10 rounds; if the character’s wounds are bound (or he or she receives healing magic) within this time frame, death is averted. The character remains unconscious for the full 2d10 rounds rolled, either dying if left untreated or awakening if his or her wounds are bound.\nBinding the wounds of the dying character stabilizes him or her at zero hit points. Non-magical healing will require a full week to restore the first hit point; after this, healing proceeds at the normal rate.\nMagical healing will restore the character to whatever total is rolled on the healing die roll (up to the usual maximum of course).\nNote that any spellcaster reduced to zero hit points who subsequently survives loses all remaining prepared spells.\nThis rule might be combined with the suggestions under Raise Dead, above.\nNegative Hit Points: Instead of stopping at zero hit points, keep track of the current negative figure. At the end of each round after he or she falls, the character loses an additional hit point. If a total of -10 is reached, the character is dead. Before this point is reached, the character may have his or her wounds bound and/or receive magical healing, which will stabilize the character. The injured character may not move more than a few feet without help, nor fight, nor cast spells, until his or her hit points are again greater than zero. This rule should not be combined with the Save vs. Death option.\nJust as with the Save vs. Death rule, spellcasters who survive being reduced to zero or negative hit points lose all currently prepared spells.\nAs a further option, the GM may choose to use a negative number equal to the character’s Constitution score rather than a straight -10.\n\n\n“Save or Die” Poison\nPoisons, as described in the Encounter and Monster sections, kill characters instantly. Game Masters may find this makes the mortality rate of player characters a bit too high. On the other hand, poisons should be scary. Here’s an optional rule which may make things a bit easier without entirely removing the fear from poison:\nWhere a “save or die” poison is indicated, the victim must make a save vs. Poison or suffer 1d6 damage per round for 6 rounds, starting the round following the exposure to the poison; this is an average of 21 points of damage, but even a first level character might survive with a combination of luck and healing magic. The GM may create poisons which vary from these figures, of course. If the Negative Hit Points optional rule is being used, it is suggested to increase the poison duration to 10 rounds (an average 35 points).\n\n\nAwarding Experience Points for Treasure Gained\nThe Game Master may also assign experience points for treasure gained, at a rate of 1 GP = 1 XP. This is optional; GMs wishing to advance their players to higher levels more quickly may choose to do this, while those preferring a more leisurely pace should omit it. If experience is awarded for treasure, it should be awarded only for treasure acquired and returned to a place of safety. Alternately, the GM may require treasure to be spent on training in order to count it for experience. This is a highly effective way to remove excess treasure from the campaign.\n\n\nAbility Rolls\nThere will be times when a player character tries to do something in the game that seems to have no rule covering it. In some of those cases, the only attribute the PC has that seems appropriate may be an Ability Score. Here is a suggested method for making rolls against Ability Scores that still gives better odds to higher level characters:\nThe player rolls 1d20 and adds his or her Ability Bonus for the score the GM thinks is most appropriate, as well as any situational bonus or penalty the GM assigns. Consult the following table. If the total rolled is equal to or higher than the given Target number, the roll is a success.\n\n\n\nLevel\nTarget\n\n\n\n\nNM or 1\n17\n\n\n2-3\n16\n\n\n4-5\n15\n\n\n6-7\n14\n\n\n8-9\n13\n\n\n10-11\n12\n\n\n12-13\n11\n\n\n14-15\n10\n\n\n16-17\n9\n\n\n18-19\n8\n\n\n20\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing Spells from Memory\nSometimes a Magic-User will want to prepare spells, but his or her spellbook may be unavailable; this includes when the book has been destroyed or stolen as well as times when the Magic-User has been captured or trapped.\nA Magic-User can always prepare read magic from memory. Other spells require an Intelligence ability roll, as described above, with the spell level as a penalty on the die roll.\nFailure exhausts the spell slot being prepared, just as if it had been successfully prepared and then cast; so if a 5th level Magic-User attempts to prepare fireball from memory, and fails, he or she will have no 3rd level spells for the day.\n\n\nThief Abilities\nSome players of Thieves may wish to have more control over their Thief abilities. If you study the Thief Abilities table, you’ll discover its secret: from levels 2-9, the Thief improves 30 percentiles (total) each level; from levels 10-15, 20 percentiles; and from level 16 on, 10 percentiles. If you wish to allow Thief customization, simply let the player allocate these points as he or she wishes rather than following the table. Allow no more than 10 percentiles to be added to any single Thief ability per level gain. Note also that no Thief ability may be raised above 99 percent."

    "section": "Magical Research",
    "text": "Magical Research\n\nGeneral Rules for Research\nAt some point a Magic-User or Cleric may wish to start creating magic items or inventing spells. This is termed magical research. For any research, Magic-User must have a tower or laboratory, while a Cleric requires a properly consecrated temple or church of his or her faith. In addition, there will be a cost for the creation of each item, a minimum time required to create it, and a given chance of success. If the roll fails, generally the time and money are wasted and the procedure must be started again from the beginning; however, consult the detailed rules below for exceptions.\nIn almost all cases, the Game Master should make this roll in secret. There are many situations where the character (or the player) should not know whether the roll has actually failed, or whether the GM has decided the research is impossible for the character. The GM may decide to tell the player that the research is impossible if the roll succeeds; if the roll is a failure, that is all the player should be told.\nIn general, Clerics may only create magic items reproducing the effects of Clerical spells; Clerics may also make enchanted weapons and armor, even those sorts which they may not use themselves (since they may be creating weapons or armor for other followers of their faith). Magic-Users may create any sort of magic item except for those reproducing Clerical spells for which no equivalent Magic-User spell exists.\nTime spent doing magical research must be eight-hour workdays with interruptions lasting no more than two days. Longer interruptions result in automatic failure of the project.\nThe GM may, if he or she so desires, grant Experience Points to characters who successfully complete magical research. It is suggested that the rate of such awards be 1 XP per 10 gp spent on the research. This award may be granted for all research, or only for creation of magic items, or not at all if the GM prefers to emphasize adventuring for advancement purposes.\n\n\nSpell Research\nResearching new spells is the most common type of magical research. A Magic-User may research a standard spell, removing the need for a teacher or reference; alternately, a Cleric or Magic-User may research an entirely new spell. Of course, no character may invent or research a spell of a level higher than he or she can cast.\nIf the character is inventing a spell outright, the GM must determine the spell’s level and judge whether or not the spell is possible “as is.” The GM does not have to tell the player whether the spell is possible, and in fact this may be preferable.\nThe cost to research a spell is 1,000 gp per spell level for “standard” spells, or 2,000 gp per spell level for newly invented spells; in either case, one week is required per spell level to complete the research. The chance of success is 25%, plus 5% per level of the character, minus 10% per level of the spell; the maximum chance of success is 95%.\nIf the research roll is successful, the character may add the spell to his or her spellbook (if a Magic-User) or may subsequently pray for the spell (if a Cleric). On a failure, the money and time are spent to no avail. Clerics of the same deity, faith or ethos may teach each other the prayers required to access new spells; this takes one hour per spell level. The procedure to exchange spells with other Magic-Users has already been explained (under Acquisition of Spells, above).\nAs mentioned above, the GM may decide that a proposed new spell is not “correct” for his or her campaign; too powerful, too low in level, etc. Rather than tell the player this, there are two strategies that may be used.\nFirst, the Game Master may decide to revise the spell. If the roll is a success, the GM then presents the player with a revised writeup of the spell, adjusted however the GM feels necessary for game balance purposes.\nThe alternative, more appropriate when the GM believes the spell should be higher level than the player character can cast, is to make the roll anyway. If the roll fails, that is all the player needs to know; but if it succeeds, the GM should then show the player the revised version of the spell and explain that the character may try again when he or she attains a high enough level to cast it. In this case, the GM may allow the character to reduce either the time or the cost by half when the research is attempted again at the higher level.\n\n\nMagic Item Research\nAny character who wishes to create magical items must know all (if any) spells to be imbued in the item. Items that produce effects not matching any known spell may require additional research (to devise the unknown spell) if the GM so desires.\nSome magic items require one or more special components that cannot usually be bought. Special components can only be used once on such a project. For example, the GM might require the skin of a displacer to create a cloak of displacement, or red dragon saliva to create a wand of fireballs. Note that there are specific rules for components under Other Magic Items, below.\nSpecial component requirements are entirely at the option of the Game Master, and are usually employed to slow the creation of powerful magic items that might tend to unbalance the campaign. It’s also a good way to lead the spellcaster (and his party) into dangerous adventures.\n\n\nChance of Success\nUnless given differently below, the base chance of success creating a magic item is 15% plus 5% per level of the spellcaster, plus the spellcaster’s full Intelligence (if a Magic-User) or Wisdom (if a Cleric). Thus, a 9th level spellcaster with a 15 Prime Requisite has a base chance of 75%.\n\n\nSpell Scrolls\nA spellcaster may create a scroll containing any spell he or she has access to (for a Magic-User, spells in his or her spellbook; for a Cleric, any spell the character might successfully pray for). The cost is 500 gp per spell level, and the time required is 1 day per spell level.\nReduce the chance of success based on the level of the spell being inscribed, at a rate of -10% per level.\nIf the roll fails, the enchantment of the scroll has failed; however, if the caster tries again to inscribe the same spell, either the cost or the time is reduced by half (at the character’s option).\n\n\nOther Single-Use Items\nScrolls (other than spell scrolls), potions, and a few other items (such as the rod of cancellation) are single-use items. These items may be created by Magic-Users or Clerics of the 7th level or higher.\nThe chance of success is as given for scrolls, above, when the item being created reproduces a known spell (or when the GM decides a spell must be created, as described above). For other types of items, the GM should assign a spell level as he or she sees fit, and the cost and time required is doubled (making up for the spell research or knowledge required for spell-reproducing items). The time required is one week plus one day per spell level (or equivalent), and the cost to enchant the item is 50 gp per spell level, per day.\nPotions are a special case; the character creating a potion may create a large batch, consisting of several doses, which may be bottled in separate vials or combined in a larger flask. For each additional dose created at the same time, reduce the chance of success by 5% and increase the time required by one day. Note that increasing the time required will directly increase the cost. If the roll to create the item fails, the entire batch is spoiled.\n\n\nPermanent Magic Items\nCreating permanent magic items (rings, weapons, wands, staves, and most miscellaneous magic items) requires a Magic-User or Cleric of the 9th level or higher.\nWhen enchanting an item with multiple abilities, each ability of the item requires a separate roll for success; the first failed roll ends the enchantment process. Such an item will still perform the powers or effects already successfully enchanted into it, but no further enchantment is possible.\nPermanent magic items, including weapons (described in detail below), must be created from high-quality items. The cost of such items will generally be ten times the normal cost for such an item.\n\n\nEnchanting Weapons\nThe base cost of enchanting a weapon or armor is 1,000 gp per point of bonus. For weapons with two bonuses, divide the larger bonus in half (don’t round) and add the smaller bonus; thus, a sword +1, +3 vs. dragons would cost 2,500 gp to enchant. Enchanting a weapon takes one week plus two days per point of bonus; thus, the sword described would require twelve days to enchant.\nReduce the chance of success by 10% times the bonus; so, a sword +1 would reduce the base chance 10%, while the sword +1, +3 vs. dragons described above would reduce the base chance 25%. Further, the chance of success may be increased 25% by doubling the cost and time required (this decision must be announced before the roll is made).\nFor weapons having additional powers, combine the rules above with the rules for creating permanent items. All enchantments must be applied in a single enchantment “session.”\n\n\nOther Magic Items\nMagic items can have several features. Each feature added to a magic item increases the cost and the time required, and decreases the chance of success. The features are as follows:\nCreates a spell or spell-like effect: This is the basic feature of all non-weapon magic items. The base cost of this enchantment is 500 gp per spell level; time required is five days plus two days per level. If the magic item has multiple spell or spell-like effects, add the cost and time figures together. The chance of success is reduced 5% per spell level.\nHas multiple charges: This includes, of course, wands and staffs, but several other magic items would also have charges. Each spell or spell-like effect normally has a separate pool of charges (but see next). The table below shows the various maximum charge levels and the associated cost, time and chance adjustments:\n\n\n\nCharge Level\nCost per Charge\nCharges per Day\nChance\n\n\n\n\n2-3\n+150 gp\n1\n- 5%\n\n\n4-7\n+125 gp\n2\n- 10%\n\n\n8-20\n+100 gp\n3\n- 20%\n\n\n21-30\n+75 gp\n4\n- 30%\n\n\n\nWhen using the table above, don’t count the first charge for cost or time purposes. Note that each separate pool of charges in the item must be figured separately.\nItem can be recharged: Figure the additional cost and time, and the penalty to the chance of success, for rechargeable items as being exactly twice the figures from the table above; so, creating a rechargeable item with 3 charges costs 600 gp more rather than 300 gp more, and takes two days per charge (or four extra days); the chance of success is lowered 10% rather than 5%.\nItem recharges itself: Creating a self-recharging item is expensive; apply the following adjustments to the charge cost, time and chance for items that recharge automatically. Note that self-recharging items are never “rechargeable” in that they may not be recharged other than by themselves.\n\n\n\nCharging Rate\nCost\nTime\nChance\n\n\n\n\n1 per day\nx 3\nx 2\n- 10%\n\n\nAll per day\nx 5\nx 3\n- 30%\n\n\nAll per week\nx 4\nx 2\n- 20%\n\n\n\nCharges are generic: This means that all the effects of the item draw power from the same pool of charges; most Magic-User staffs are in this category. Items with generic charges are automatically rechargeable; don’t apply the normal adjustments for this feature. Instead, combine the normal costs for the charge pools of each effect (which must all have the same number of charges), and then divide the charge cost, time and chance adjustments by two. Thus, two effects sharing one pool costs the same as a single effect with a single pool.\nItem may be used by any class: By default, magic items may only be used by the class that created them; so a wand of fireballs is normally usable only by Magic-Users, or a staff of healing only by Clerics. This feature allows the item to be used by any class of character, and involves assigning simple command words and gestures to the item. Adding this feature costs 1,000 gp per effect. Note that all the item’s effects do not have to be covered; it is possible to create an item where some effects may be used by any class, but other effects may only be used by the creator’s class.\nItem operates continuously or automatically: This feature supersedes both the charges and item use features. The item works whenever properly worn, or activates automatically when required. A ring of fire resistance is a good example; also, the ring of invisibility is in this category. Adding this feature multiplies the final cost and time figures by five and applies a 40% penalty to the chance of success.\nEach feature above applied to a magic item will require a valuable, rare and/or magical material to support the enchantment. For example, a wand of fireballs has a spell effect that is powered by charges; these are two relatively ordinary features, so the Magic-User creating the item proposes a rare wood for the shaft and a 1,000 gp value ruby for the tip. The GM may, of course, require something more rare or valuable if the magic item is particularly powerful.\nThe base cost of a spell effect feature can be reduced by 25% by applying limits to the ability. For example, a ring of charm dryad is an example of limited charm person spell effect, which would qualify for the deduction. This does not affect the chance of success or the time required.\nWeapons which are to be enchanted with additional powers other than the normal bonus require combining the standard weapon enchantment rules with the rules given above. Perform the weapon enchantment first; if it is successful, then the character enchanting the weapon must immediately (within two days, as previously explained) begin the spell or spell-like power enchantment process. Failure of the second procedure does not spoil the weapon enchantment.\n\n\nCursed Items\nSome cursed items, such as cursed scrolls, are created that way specifically by the spellcaster. The difficulty of creating such an item is roughly the same as the difficulty of creating a spell scroll of bestow curse.\nOther cursed magic items may be the result of a failed attempt to create a useful item. The GM must decide whether or not a failed research project will actually create a cursed item."

    "section": "Designing a Dungeon Adventure",
    "text": "Designing a Dungeon Adventure\n\n1. Think About Why\nWhen creating a dungeon, the first question you must answer is: Why will your player characters risk going into this dangerous dungeon full of monsters and traps?\nHere are some possible scenarios:\nTo Explore the Unknown: This is common in pulp fiction. One or more of the player characters has heard of some ancient site, and wishes to explore purely for knowledge. Possibly some of the other player characters are involved for other reasons.\nTo Battle An Evil Incursion: Goblins are raiding farms in the area, and the Baron has offered a reward for stopping the raids; the player characters are happy to help.\nTo Rescue A Kidnapped Victim: Some friend of the player characters has been kidnapped, and they must sneak into or storm the villain’s tower/cave/dungeon to rescue the victim. Or, perhaps, the victim is the son or daughter of the local Baron or a wealthy merchant who offers a reward for the safe return of his or her offspring.\nTo Fulfill A Quest: The local church, to whom the player characters owe a favor, would like an ancient relic recovered from a lost mountain fortress, and the High Priest asks them to look into it; or some similar task might be assigned, depending on who the player characters owe a favor.\nTo Get Loot: This is a surprisingly common scenario (well, perhaps not so surprising). The dungeon is rumored to contain a hidden treasure of great value, and the first characters to find it will be rich! Of course, the treasure might not be that huge, and might be guarded by any number of horrific monsters…\nTo Escape Confinement: The player characters have been captured by an enemy, and find themselves incarcerated without their weapons, armor, or equipment. This scenario must be used with care, as the GM must not be seen to be “railroading” the characters into the adventure.\nThere are many other possible scenarios, and each has many variations. Knowing the answer to this question will make the next questions easier to answer.\n\n\n2. What Kind Of Setting Is It?\nIs the dungeon beneath a ruined fortress, or an ancient wizard’s tower? Or perhaps it’s a natural cave, which has been expanded by kobolds… or the tomb of an ancient barbarian warlord, guarded by undead monsters… there are many possibilities.\n\n\n3. Choose Special Monsters\nNow you know why the player characters want to go there (or why they will, when they learn of the dungeon), and you know what sort of place it is. Next, decide what special monsters you will place within. For instance, the natural cave expanded by kobolds contains kobolds, obviously, while the warlord’s tomb contains some undead, zombies and skeletons perhaps.\n\n\n4. Draw The Dungeon Map\nDungeon maps can be drawn on graph paper in pencil, or created on the computer with any of a broad variety of dungeon-drawing programs. (If you like the design of the maps in the official Basic Fantasy RPG adventure modules, be sure to visit www.basicfantasy.org and try out our map designer, MapMatic +2.) When creating a dungeon for personal use, there is certainly no good reason not to use pencil and paper. Below is an example of a hand-drawn dungeon map, with the various symbols noted:\n\n\n5. Stock The Dungeon\n“Stocking” the dungeon refers to assigning contents to each room. There are several possibilities; a room might contain a monster (which might or might not have treasure), a trap (which might guard a treasure, or might not), an “unguarded” treasure, a “special” (something other than a monster, trap, or treasure; often a puzzle of some sort), or be “empty.”\nThe GM may choose the contents of any room, or may roll on the table below:\n\n\n\nd%\nContents\n\n\n\n\n01-16\nEmpty\n\n\n17-20\nUnguarded Treasure\n\n\n21-60\nMonster\n\n\n61-84\nMonster with Treasure\n\n\n85-88\nSpecial\n\n\n89-96\nTrap\n\n\n97-00\nTrap with Treasure\n\n\n\nAn unguarded treasure will generally be hidden (such as in a secret room, inside an unusual container, etc.) or protected by a trap (a poison needle in the lock of a chest, or a poison gas canister that explodes if the container is opened, or something similar); such a treasure might even be hidden and trapped! Again, some sort of saving throw should be allowed if a trap is used. It’s not a bad idea to hide a treasure so well that the player characters are unlikely to find it; don’t be concerned if they don’t. If you give away the location of all your unguarded treasures, your players will not appreciate it properly when they manage to find one by cleverness or luck.\nA monster might be selected by the GM or rolled on the random encounter tables. It’s traditional that the first level (below ground) contains monsters of 1 hit die or less, the second level contains monsters of around 2 hit dice, and so on, but the GM may choose to arrange his or her dungeon in any way desired.\nA monster with treasure might indicate a lair, or it might be a group of monsters carrying loot, possibly camping for some reason before moving on.\nA trap is, obviously, some sort of device intended to harm the player characters, including such things as pendulum blades, hidden pits, spear-chucking devices, and so forth. A trap with treasure is such a trap protecting a treasure, which might be in the room beyond the trap or actually within it (such as in a pit). See the Traps section, below, for more information.\nA special might be a puzzle of some sort, such as a door that can only be opened by a combination (hidden elsewhere in the dungeon); or perhaps an oracle that answers questions about the dungeon (but possibly it lies). The classic “magic fountain” that randomly changes the ability scores of the drinker is another possibility; if this is done, some sort of limit should be imposed (such as, the device only affects a given creature once, or the device causes harm more often than it gives aid) to prevent abuse. In general, a “special” room is any room containing something that either interests or obstructs the player characters but is not a monster, trap, or unguarded treasure.\nEmpty rooms contain no monsters, traps, unguarded treasures, or specials. This does not mean that they are truly “empty;” a room might contain a fireplace, upholstered chairs, side tables, torch sconces, and curtains, and still be considered empty. Hide a treasure in a secret drawer in a side table, and it becomes an unguarded treasure room; in other words, to be empty there has to be basically nothing of serious interest to the player characters in the room.\n\n\n6. Finishing Touches\nThe GM may wish to create one or more custom wandering monster tables for the dungeon; monster patrols, if any, may need to be described; and possibly some locations may have unusual sounds, smells, graffiti, etc. which need to be noted. Don’t spend too much time on this, though.\nRemember, if you only detail the “interesting” things, your players will begin to guess what might be in a room. Some extra description will help make things uncertain for the players. For instance, a room with an unguarded treasure:\nGame Master: This room contains a chest, centered against the far wall.\nPlayer 1: We look for monsters, and if we don’t see any, the thief will check the chest for traps.\nKind of boring, right? This might be better:\nGame Master: In this room you see a comfortable-looking upholstered chair, a side table and a foot stool. Two burned-out torches are held by sconces on each wall.\nPlayer 1: If we don’t see any monsters, the thief will check the table and the footstool for traps and see if anything is hidden inside them, while the rest of us check for secret doors… one of those sconces might open one.\nA little extra detail can add a lot to the adventure.\n\n\nTraps\nSome suggestions of typical traps are listed below, to assist the GM. Deadlier traps can be created by combining simple traps, by making their effects harder to avoid, or by making them capable of dealing more damage.\nTraps are not necessarily reliable; the GM may choose to make a roll of some sort for each potential victim until the trap is sprung (say, 1-2 on 1d6). Or, a trap door might not open until a given weight is placed on it, so that a lightly loaded thief might cross without difficulty, only to see his heavily armored warrior ally fall victim to it.\nAlarm: Everyone within a 30’ radius must save vs Spells or be deafened for 1d8 turns by the loud noise. The GM should check immediately for wandering monsters, which, if indicated, will arrive in 2d10 rounds.\nArrow Trap: A hidden, mounted crossbow attacks at AB +1, doing 1d6+1 points of damage on a successful hit.\nChute: These are usually covered with a hidden trap door. The triggering character must save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or tumble down to lower level of the dungeon. Chutes usually do little or no damage to the victim.\nFalling stones or bricks: Rocks fall from the ceiling. The triggering character must save vs. Paralysis or Petrify (with Dexterity bonus added) or take 1d10 points of damage.\nFlashing Light: With a loud snap, a bright light goes off in the face of the character that triggered the trap. That character, and anyone else looking directly at it, must save vs. Spells or be blinded for 1d8 turns.\nMonster-Attracting Spray: A strong-smelling but harmless liquid is sprayed on the triggering character. The smell attracts predatory creatures, doubling the chances of wandering monsters for 1d6 hours or until washed off.\nOil Slick: Oil is sprayed onto the floor of the room. Anyone trying to walk through the oil must save vs Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or fall prone. Oil is highly flammable and may be ignited by torches or other flame sources held by characters who slip and fall into it.\nPit Trap: Usually hidden with a breakable cover, trap door, or illusion. The victim must save vs Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or fall into the pit, taking damage according to the distance fallen (see “Falling Damage”). A pit trap can be made deadlier by placing spikes, acid, or dangerous creatures at the bottom, or partly filling it with water to represent a drowning hazard.\nPoison Dart Trap: A spring-loaded dart launcher attacks at AB +1 for 1d4 points of damage, and the victim must save vs. Poison or die.\nPoison Gas: Gas emerges from vents to fill the room. All within the affected area must save vs. Poison or die. Poison gases are sometimes highly flammable and may be ignited by torches or other flame sources, doing perhaps 1d6 points of damage to each character in the area of effect (with a save vs. Dragon Breath allowed to avoid the damage).\nPoison Needle Trap: A tiny, spring-loaded needle pops out of a keyhole or other small aperture and injects poison into the finger of the character who triggered the trap (most likely, a Thief trying to pick the lock), who must save vs. Poison or die.\nPortcullis: A falling gate blocks the passage. The character who triggered the trap must save vs Death Ray or take 3d6 points of damage.\nRolling Boulder Trap: A spherical or cylindrical rock rolls down a slanting corridor. Anyone in its path must save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added) or take 2d6 points of damage. Alternately, if the corridor has no other place for the character to escape to (that is, no room for the character to step out of the path of the rock), it may be necessary to outrun the rock to avoid the damage.\nBlade Trap: A blade or spear drops down from the ceiling or pops out of the wall and attacks at AB +1 for 1d8 points of damage. Particularly large blades might attack everyone along a 10’ or 20’ line.\nTriggered Spell: When activated, a spell of the GM’s choice is cast, targeting or centered on the character who triggered it. Popular choices include curses, illusions, or a wall of fire."

    "title": "21  Crafting Adventures",
    "section": "Designing a Wilderness Adventure",
    "text": "Designing a Wilderness Adventure\n\n1. Think About Why\nThis is much the same task as was described above. The player characters may enter a particular area looking for a town to resupply from, a church or temple to provide healing services, or for many other reasons. Once in the area, the Game Master can make the player characters aware of adventuring opportunities in the area, by means of rumors, posted bounties (such as for raiding humanoids), quests offered by local clergy, and so forth.\n\n\n2. What Kind Of Setting Is It?\nDecide whether the area is deep in the wilderness, or in more inhabited territories, what sort of climate will be found there, how many towns, and of what size, are present, and so on.\nYou may choose to design a new territory based on the goals of the player characters in your campaign. For example, if the player characters decide to seek their fortunes in the richest city in the world, you could decide where this is and begin to describe it by providing rumors of its wealth and splendor told by far-wandering merchants. If these descriptions intrigue the characters and they travel toward the city, you will have time to decide what terrain – and dangers – lie in their path.\nOn the other hand, your setting should make sense, which will help players make meaningful choices when traveling. For example, areas under human control will be settled, with signs of civilization such as cleared land for agriculture, roads, strongholds, etc. Areas dominated by humanoid monsters, or which are being raided by wandering humanoids, will be battle-scarred and will not have food or other goods available. A valley that was settled many years ago but abandoned after a dragon attacked could contain ruined buildings, their walls likely still bearing the marks of flame and claw, and fields grown high with saplings.\n\n\n3. Draw An Area Map\nNow it’s time to draw the area map. Some Game Masters prefer to draw maps freehand, while others like to use hex or graph paper; of course, programs are available to create maps on a computer as well. It is a good idea to provide a scale for the map, which can be whatever best fits the map and the area you want to depict. A scale of 18 miles per square or hex is a good choice for a large-scale map, as this is the distance that a group of humans can cover in a day in clear terrain (see Wilderness Movement Rates), which makes it easy to determine travel times.\nRivers and coastline, hills and mountains, forests and plains must be clear on the map. All of these areas should have an appropriate climate: for example, the windward side of a mountain range will usually receive a great deal of rain, while the other side will be dry. You may choose to create an area with abnormal weather for its location, such as a sandy desert in the midst of a rain forest, but this should be unusual, a tip to observant players that strange magic is involved.\nGo ahead and place any interesting sites such as towns, ruins, and significant monster lairs. Remember, in most cases your party of adventurers will need some base of operations, be it a city, town, village, or border fortress.\n\n\n4. Detail Interesting Sites And People\nDescribe at least the base town, and the dungeon you expect the party to visit first. Also detail any set or placed encounters you laid out in the step above. There is lots of room for creativity here: a distant, unfamiliar town may have different laws, traditions, or currency. You should also describe key NPCs and their connections to each other. NPCs have their own goals and plans, which may or may not involve the PCs, and the actions of player characters toward one person will often influence how others treat them. Don’t go overboard trying to detail every single place on the map… leave some room for expansion later, after you have a feel for your players and their characters.\n\n\n5. Create Encounter Tables\nWhen designing a wilderness area, one touch that will really set it apart is a custom encounter table. Choose those monsters that seem most appropriate to the area, using the standard encounter tables as a guide. If you have placed humanoid lairs or encampments, you may wish to include their patrols on the custom table.\nAnother alternative is to roll six or eight or ten random encounters using the “generic” encounter table for the relevant terrain type, and use that list as your random encounter table for the area. When doing this, you probably should re-roll duplicates."

    "title": "21  Crafting Adventures",
    "section": "Strongholds",
    "text": "Strongholds\nMany player characters, upon reaching higher levels, choose to settle down and build a stronghold. Generally this is allowed when a character reaches 9th level or higher. The player character must obtain land on which to build; in some lands, frontier territory may be made available to any freeman (or freewoman) who can tame it; in others, land may be available for someone with enough gold; while in other cases the character will need to petition the local Count, Duke or King for a land grant.\nUsually, Fighters build castles, Magic-Users build towers, Clerics build temples and Thieves build guildhouses, but this is not always so. Any character who builds a stronghold suitable to his or her class will attract 1st level followers of the same class as follows:\n\n\n\nClass\nNumber of Followers\n\n\n\n\nFighter\n3d6\n\n\nMagic-User\n1d8\n\n\nCleric\n2d8\n\n\nThief\n2d6\n\n\n\nThese followers will assist the character, but will not go on adventures away from the stronghold in most cases (especially dangerous dungeon adventures). They live from the income generated by the stronghold. The primary sources of this income are taxes on peasants for castles, fees for magical services and students’ tuition for towers, tithing from the faithful for temples, and criminal activities for guildhouses. A stronghold must have 200 square feet of living space for each follower, as well as quarters for guests, stables for horses, and so on.\nA player who wants to build a stronghold should draw its floor plan. Each story is usually 10’ tall. The construction costs for the stronghold are determined by the square footage of its walls, floors and roofs, the materials used, and the thickness of the walls.\nMake sure not to double-count corners on walls that are 5’ thick or thicker – count the length of only one face. When determining wall length for round walls and towers, approximate pi by 3, since the inner face of the wall has a shorter circumference. The table below gives costs in gp for each 10’ square section of wall. The number by the material is its hardness, which is deducted from damage to the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall material\n1’ thick\n5’ thick\n10’ thick\n15’ thick\n\n\nMaximum height\n40’\n60’\n80’\n100’\n\n\nWood (H 6)\n10 gp\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n\n\nBrick (H 8)\n20 gp\n50 gp\nn/a\nn/a\n\n\nSoft stone (H 12)\n30 gp\n70 gp\n200 gp\nn/a\n\n\nHard stone (H 16)\n40 gp\n90 gp\n260 gp\n350 gp\n\n\n\nA 1’ thick wall is made of solid pieces of material held with mortar (or pegs and ropes for wooden walls); such walls may be at most 40’ tall. A 5’ thick wall consists of two 1’ thick walls sandwiching 3’ of earth and rubble; such a wall may be at most 60’ tall. A 10’ thick wall consists of a 4’ thick outer wall and a 2’ thick inner wall sandwiching 4’ of earth and rubble, and may be built up to 80’ tall. A 15’ thick wall consists of a 6’ thick outer wall and a 2’ thick inner wall sandwiching 7’ of earth and rubble; these walls may be built up to 100’ tall. To attain the maximum height, thinner walls can be used on upper stories. For example, an 80 ft. tower must have at least 20’ of 10’ thick walls at the base, but more could be used.\nThe character will have to pay engineering costs for designing the stronghold, and tall structures are more difficult to design and to build. For each portion of the stronghold (wall, tower, and so on), each 10’ of height adds 10% to the costs in both time and money. The GM should feel free to add a multiplier to reflect the difficulties of building in a remote area, obtaining materials, etc. In particular, if materials need to be transported, they require 1 ton of cargo space per 5 gp of wood or stone construction. (The increased weight of stone compensates for its compactness compared to wood.)\nA building over 40’ high must have a solid foundation, and if over 60’ high, it must rest on bedrock.\nA stronghold requires one worker-day of construction labor for every gp it costs to build. Adding more workers reduces construction time, but the time cannot be reduced below the square root of the time for one worker to build the stronghold. Assume that there are 140 working days per year (seven months of 20 working days each) in temperate climates.\nFloors and thatched roofs cost as much and take as long to build as it would take to build the square footage of their bases of 1’ thick wood walls. Wood-shingled roofs cost twice this amount and take twice as long to build, while slate-shingled roofs cost four times as much and take four times as long. (You don’t need to calculate the greater surface area of a pitched roof, since the increased height increases construction costs enough to cover this.)\nThese costs include normal features of construction such as stairs, doors and windows. Interior walls are not included; they are usually 1’ thick. Parapets, which provide cover for defenders atop castle walls and towers, are usually 1’ thick and 5’ high (so they are half-cost).\nNote that guildhouses are almost always built in cities and thus are usually built with 1’ thick exterior walls, but they cost twice as much to build due to the traps and secret passageways that are designed into them. A Magic-User’s tower costs three times as much to build, due to the need for ancient books, alchemical equipment, and other supplies for conducting research.\nFor example, Sir Percy, a 9th-level Fighter, desires to build a 60’ tall square keep (50’ walls with a 10’ peaked slate-shingled roof) that is 50’ square. The keep will have four stories and an attic, and the first story, which will contain the great hall, will be 20’ high. Sir Percy wishes his keep to be strongly built, so he tells his architect to build with hard stone and use 10’ thick walls for the first two stories and 5’ thick walls for the rest. The first and second floors will thus be 30’ square or 900 square feet, and the third and fourth floors will be 40’ square or 1,600 square feet. With a total floor area of 5,000 square feet, Sir Percy’s keep will house him and up to 24 other people (or animals such as horses, which during an attack may be stabled in the great hall!) in acceptable comfort. Its floor plans are shown on the next page.\nThe first floor has 30 (= 5 [for 50’ length] x 2 [for 20’ height] x 4 walls, minus 8 sections double-counted at the corners and 2 sections for the entrance) 10’ square sections of 10’ thick hard stone walls, which cost 7,800 gp, and 9 10’ square sections of floor, which cost 90 gp, for a total cost of 7,890 gp. The second floor is the same as the first, except that the walls are 10’ high and there is no deduction for an entrance, giving a cost of 4,250 gp. The third and fourth floors each require 18 sections of 5’ thick hard stone walls, costing 1,620 gp, and 16 sections of floor, costing 160 gp, for a total of 1,780 gp per floor. The 50’ square roof costs 4 x 25 x 10 = 1,000 gp, and the 40’ square attic floor adds 160 gp. The design calls for a total of 770’ of 1’ thick interior walls and doors, which would cost 30,800 gp if made of hard stone; Sir Percy uses wood, which costs only 7,700 gp. These costs total 24,560 gp, but since the keep is 60’ high, its cost is increased by 60% to 39,296 gp. The keep will require 39,296 worker-days. Sir Percy may employ up to 198 workers to build the keep, in which case it will take 198 working days to build, or a year and three months’ time. Keep in mind what might happen in this time, given that the area is dangerous enough to warrant building a castle.\nDungeons: A stronghold may also have a dungeon excavated under it. A dungeon is an excellent place to store perishable supplies, a good shelter if the castle is overrun, and often incorporates an escape route if all is lost for the castle’s defenders or a secret way out for raids is desired. Magic-Users sometimes encourage monsters to take up residence in their dungeons, as they provide a convenient source of supplies for magical research and help keep away unwanted guests. Use the following figures for skilled workers, such as dwarves or goblins, to create dungeons; double the times for less skilled miners.\n\n\n\nMaterial\nTime for one worker to excavate a 5’ cube\n\n\n\n\nEarth\n5 days (supports are required)\n\n\nSoft stone\n10 days\n\n\nHard stone\n20 days\n\n\n\nStructural strength and breaches: A section of stronghold wall has as many hit points as its base cost in gp (for example, a section of 10’ thick soft stone wall has 200 hit points). Stone and brick walls only take damage from crushing blows, while wood walls are also affected by fire and chopping attacks. If a given section of wall loses all of its hit points, it is breached, allowing attackers to pass through. If a breach occurs on a lower course of wall, there is a 40% chance that the 10’ section above it will be breached by collapse, and a 20% chance that the section below it will be breached. These secondary breaches have the same chances of affecting the next 10’ section above or below them, and so on until the top or bottom course of wall is reached. If a breach occurs on a right or acute corner (90 degrees or less), the chances of breaches double in each direction.\nAttacking a Castle: Siege engines are difficult to aim, but as castles don’t dodge around, each successive shot by a given siege engine with a given crew has an increasing chance of hitting. To reflect this, the first attack on a castle’s walls is made against Armor Class 20; each subsequent attack by that weapon, fired by that crew, at that same point in the wall, is made against an Armor Class one lower than the previous shot, to a minimum AC of 11.\nAttacks on a castle’s defenders are at -4 on the attack roll if they are standing on the parapets, and at -10 if they are behind arrow slits. Since characters defending the castle do move around, the odds of hitting them with a siege engine do not improve from shot to shot. There is an additional -2 on the attack roll for missile attacks if the defenders are more than 20’ higher than the attackers; this is not specifically due to altitude, but rather because the defenders can use more of the wall for cover. The defenders can take advantage of their height by dropping objects on attackers near the castle’s base; these missiles do 2d10 points of damage, but they have a -2 attack penalty if dropped from a height of 30’ or more.\nSiege engines can damage several adjacent characters; roll damage separately for each character in the 10’ square hit by the missile. Of course, the attack roll must be high enough to damage each one; a roll of 19 against characters having Armor Classes of 18 and 20 would hit the former but not the latter.\nA castle may also be attacked by mining. This method of attack involves tunneling under the castle wall, then setting fire to the supports of the tunnel to cause the wall to collapse. It is also slow, and if the castle has a moat, the tunnel must avoid it, which requires that it be dug deeper, requiring twice the time. A mine is dug like a dungeon, and once its supports are fired, the wall above is breached; if the mine is only 5’ wide, there is only a 50% chance of causing a breach.\nFinally, a screw may be used to attack a stronghold. This device, which costs 200 gp, is used to bore through castle walls. A crew of at least eight is required to operate it. It is only used at the base of a wall, and it is usually operated under a sow, or portable roof, as it is slow. (A sow typically costs about 100 gp.) The device does 1d8 points of damage per turn, but it ignores hardness. A breach caused by a screw is small, so it has only half the usual chance of spreading to the next course of wall, unless widened by miners."
