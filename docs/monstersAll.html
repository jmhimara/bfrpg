<p>Giant ants are among the hardiest and most adaptable vermin. Soldiers and workers are about 5 to 6 feet long, while queens can grow to a length of 9 feet. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair.</p>
<p>Giant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets.</p>
<p>Large and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length. Though smaller, their colonies have more members, and so their lair treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of giant ants.</p>

<p>The statistics above represent common sorts of wild herd animals, including deer (1 hit die), aurochs (2 hit dice), elk or moose (3 hit dice) and bison (4 hit dice). Such creatures are often skittish and likely to flee if provoked, but males are more aggressive in the presence of females (the parenthesized morale applies in this case).</p>
<p>Generally, 1 hit die herd animals inflict 1d4 points of damage on a hit, 2 and 3 hit die animals inflict 1d6, and 4 hit die animals inflict 1d8. The GM should feel free to vary from these figures as he or she sees fit; there are many types of herd animals in the world, and some are better armed than others.</p>

<p>These powerful creatures resemble gorillas but are far more aggressive; though they are actually omnivores, they prefer meat, and they kill and eat anything they can catch. An adult male carnivorous ape is 5-1/2 to 6 feet tall and weighs 300 to 400 pounds.</p>

<p>The assassin vine is a semi-mobile plant found in temperate forests that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots.</p>
<p>Because it can lie very still indeed, an assassin vine surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.</p>
<p>An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.</p>
<p>A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine.</p>
<p>A subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown, and white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.</p>

<p>Barklings are diminutive furry humanoids with very dog-like faces. They stand between 2½ and 3½ feet tall and typically weigh around 45 pounds. They are pack hunters by nature, shy when encountered singly or in small groups but bold when their numbers are overwhelming. Use the higher morale figure when a barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3 combatants to 1 or more.</p>
<p>Barklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature and relative lack of strength; all such weapons do 1d4 points of damage on a hit.</p>
<p>Barklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they excel; a barkling can track almost any living or corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been as much as a day since it passed.</p>
<p>In combat barklings usually wear chainmail armor which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor Class given above).</p>
<p>One out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP). In barkling encampments, one out of every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In villages of 50 or more there will be a barkling lord of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage. Barklings gain a +1 bonus to their morale as long as they are led by any of their leaders.</p>
<p>In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is present). A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level 1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.</p>
<p>Barklings are sometimes confused with kobolds, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult.</p>

<p>A basilisk is a giant six-legged lizard-like monster that petrifies living creatures with its gaze. A basilisk has dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale yellow or white belly. Adults reach a body length of 5 to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a weight of 250 to 400 pounds. There is no particular difference in size between males and females.</p>
<p>Any living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must save vs.&nbsp;Petrify or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs.&nbsp;Petrify or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.</p>
<p>The greater basilisk appears identical to the common variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing between 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greater basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare skin must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die. This effect persists even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20 hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea.</p>

<p>Bats are nocturnal flying mammals. The statistics presented here describe small, insectivorous bats. They have a natural sonar that allows them to operate in total darkness; for game purposes, treat this ability as Darkvision.</p>
<p>A group of normal-sized bats has no effective attack (at least in terms of doing damage) but can confuse those in the area, flying around apparently randomly. For every ten bats in the area, one creature can be confused; such a creature will suffer a penalty of -2 on all attack and saving throw rolls while the bats remain in the area.</p>
<p>A giant bat has a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs about 200 pounds. They have the same sensory abilities as normal-sized bats, but being much larger, they are able to attack adventurers; many are carnivorous, making such attacks likely.</p>

<p>Bears attack by rending opponents with their claws, dragging them in and biting them.

<p>Giant bees live in hives, generally in underground areas. In each such hive will be a queen who has 2 hit dice and inflicts only a bite doing 1d8 points of damage. She is immobile, and if she is threatened all bees in the hive will fight without checking morale. The queen is worth 75 XP if defeated.</p>
<p>Those stung by a giant bee must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die. A giant bee that successfully stings another creature pulls away, leaving its stinger in the creature; the bee then dies.</p>
<p>Each giant bee hive will contain honeycomb filled with honey, which is entirely safe to eat and is worth 10 GP per gallon if carefully removed. Generally 2d10+10 gallons of honey will be present in any given hive. There is also a 15% chance that one of the cells in the honeycomb will contain special honey which acts as 1d6+1 <a href="./magicItems.html#potions">Potions of Healing</a> if consumed.

<p>Giant bombardier beetles have red head and thorax sections and black abdomens. They are 3 to 4 feet long. In combat, a giant bombardier beetle bites opponents in front of it, and sprays a cone of very hot and noxious gases from a nozzle in the rearmost tip of the abdomen. This toxic blast causes 2d6 points of damage to all within a cone 10’ long and 10’ wide at the far end (a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray for half damage is allowed). A giant bombardier beetle can use this spray attack up to five times per day, but no more often than once per three rounds. Faced with opponents attacking from just one direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to turn away and use the spray attack rather than biting.</p>
<p>Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have more or less the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.</p>

<p>Giant fire beetles are huge, being 18 to 30 inches long, and have shiny black carapaces. Each has a pair of glowing red organs located just below their eyes which illuminate a radius of 10 feet around the creature. These glands continue to glow for 1d6 days after one is killed, and may be removed and used for illumination by any adventurers not too squeamish to do so.</p>
<p>They are normally timid but will fight if cornered. Like most beetles, they have more or less the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus those who attack them from behind receive no bonus to do so.</p>

<p>Giant oil beetles are about 3 feet long, and are often found burrowing in soil or roaming dungeon corridors. Their eyes are arranged on the sides of their heads such that they can see perfectly well behind them as well as in front, negating any normal bonus for attacking from behind.</p>
<p>In addition to its bite, a giant oil beetle can attack with a spray of oil from its abdomen; this can only be applied to opponents within 5 feet of the back of the beetle, and an attack roll is needed to hit. Living creatures hit by this spray suffer a penalty of -2 on all attack rolls for 24 hours due to painful blisters inflicted by the irritating oil. A <a href="./allSpells.html#cure-light-wounds">cure light wounds</a> spell may be used to remove this effect, but if so used the spell does not also restore hit points to the victim</p>

<p>Black puddings are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic matter, living or dead. They attack any creatures they encounter, lashing out with pseudopods or simply engulfing opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that help them catch and digest their prey.</p>
<p>If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with lightning or electricity, a black pudding suffers no injury, but will be split into two puddings; the GM should divide the original black pudding’s hit dice between the two however he or she sees fit, with the limitation that neither pudding may have less than two hit dice. A two hit die black pudding is simply unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split further.</p>
<p>Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black pudding, but such an attack will paralyze the pudding for one round per die of damage the attack would normally cause. Other attack forms will affect a black pudding normally; the preferred method of killing one usually involves fire.</p>
<p>The typical black pudding measures 10 feet across and 2 feet thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black puddings of smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly as a result of the splitting described above.</p>

<p>Blink dogs, also known as flicker beasts, are strange creatures which resemble wolves or hyenas who can teleport up to 120 feet at will. Teleportation is so easy for them that they can sometimes teleport away before being attacked; specifically, when a flicker beast know of the attacker’ presence. The flicker beast is allowed a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Death Ray, and on a successful roll teleports 1d6 x 10 feet in a random direction (but never into solid matter, nor into any dangerous area the creature knows about).</p>
<p>These creatures are pack hunters, using their teleportation to confuse their prey until they are able to surround it. In this way, some members of the pack will be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to hit and double damage if the hit is successful.</p>
<p>Blink dogs are large canines, typically light brown in color with short bristly hair; some varieties are striped or spotted. They communicate using a language of barks, growls, and yips which is somewhat limited but can convey useful tactical information. They are shy, generally avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate <a href="./monstersAll.html#deceiver-panther-hydra">deceivers</a> and will generally attack them on sight.</p>

<p>Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually animated plants, dimly aware of their surroundings. These plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.</p>
<p>The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30’ from the plant in ideal conditions. Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or become befuddled, dropping anything carried and approaching the plant. Each round such a creature or character is within the affected area, this save must be made. Befuddled characters will not resist the plant-creature’s attacks; if affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters, constructs, etc. are not affected.</p>
<p>Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded with thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day) “eaten” this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed.</p>

<p>Bugbears look like huge, hairy goblins, standing about 6 feet tall. Their eyes are usually a darkish brown color and they move very quietly. They are wild and relatively fearless, and bully smaller humanoids whenever possible.</p>
<p>Bugbears prefer to ambush opponents if they can. When hunting, they often send scouts ahead of the main group. Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant. They are able to move in nearly complete silence, surprising opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. In order to remain silent, they must wear only leather or hide armor, as indicated in the Armor Class scores above. Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage due to their great Strength. As with most goblinoid monsters, they have Darkvision with a 30’ range.</p>
<p>One out of every eight bugbears will be a hardened warrior of 4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to damage. In lairs of 16 or more bugbears, there will be a chieftain of 6+6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with a +3 bonus to damage. Bugbears gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a hardened warrior or chieftain. In the lair, bugbears never fail a morale check as long as the chieftain is alive. In addition, there is a 2 in 6 chance that a shaman will be present in a lair. A shaman is equal to an ordinary bugbear statistically, but possesses 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities.</p>

<p>Caecilia are carnivorous, legless amphibians; they strongly resemble earthworms, but they have bony skeletons and sharp teeth. Caecilia live entirely underground. The giant variety grows up to 30’ long and frequently are found in caverns or dungeons. They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.</p>
<p>A caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid or demi-human (such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers 1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit, fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to the attack roll are applied.</p>
<p>Once a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and digest its meal.</p>

<p>Cattle are large mammals with cloven hooves and horned heads. Cattle are raised mostly for their meat (beef), leather, and milk. Cattle eat grass and are fairly gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede (run in a group). Anyone caught in the path of the stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as determined by the GM. Male cattle are called bulls, females are cows, and young are calves (calf is singular). If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using their horns to attack. Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure), and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd. A bull will likely attack if he sees quick movements from creatures he might be able to reach with a charge. Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a roughly circular formation with their heads outward, while calves will be kept in the center, though if the opponents are small enough they may instead charge en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.</p>
<p>A typical small farm with cattle will have a bull, 5d4 cows, and 2d10 calves (but not more than the number of cows).</p>
<p>Aurochs are wild cattle; they are shaggy and rough- looking. Bison are the largest species of wild bovines. All types of bovines tend to behave in the same general way, as described above.</p>
<p>An ox is typically a castrated bull used as a draft animal; females may be used, rarely, but males are preferred due to their greater size and strength. Oxen are usually paired as a team to pull a fully-loaded wagon (or the equivalent of 3,000 lb). Oxen require less food and water, being able to eat rough grass better than draft horses, which makes them valuable to merchants with large caravans going over semi-arid prairie.</p>

<p>Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that live underground. An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long. They are eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a variety of touch-sensitive “hairs” on their legs to sense the environment around them.</p>
<p>These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.</p>
<p>All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed, attracting wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p>Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not interrupt the monster’s shrieking.</p>
<p>A giant cave locust can leap up to 60’ horizontally, or up to 30’ up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.</p>
<p>Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10’ away. Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell.</p>

<p>Centaurs appear to be half man, half horse, having the torso, arms and head of a man in the position a horse’s head would otherwise occupy. A centaur is as big as a heavy horse, but much taller and slightly heavier; average males are about 7 feet tall and weigh about 2,100 pounds, and females are just a bit smaller. Centaurs may charge with a spear or lance just as a man on horseback, with the same bonuses. They typically wear leather armor when prepared for combat.</p>

<p>Giant centipedes are larger versions of the normal sort, being 2 to 3 feet long. Centipedes are fast-moving, predatory, venomous arthropods, having long segmented bodies with exoskeletons. They prefer to live in underground areas, shadowy forested areas, and other places out of direct sunlight; however, there are desert-dwelling varieties that hide under the sand waiting for prey to wander by.</p>
<p>Giant centipedes tend to attack anything that resembles food, biting with their jaws and injecting their poison. Those bitten by a giant centipede must save vs.&nbsp;Poison at +2 or die.</p>

A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera’s dragon head might be black, blue, green, red, or white, and has the same type of breath weapon as that sort of dragon.

<p>Displacers are blue-black, catlike monsters with strange bladed winglike arms extending from their shoulders. The blades are carried folded back like wings, but the Displacer swings the blades around in front to attack.</p>
<p>The real power and danger of the Displacer is its power of&nbsp;<strong>displacement</strong>, which causes the monster’s apparent location to shift around constantly over a range of 3’ from the monster’s true location. This is a form of illusion, but a powerful form that cannot be seen through even by those who know the secret.</p>
<p>Any character fighting a Displacer for the first time will miss his or her first strike regardless of the die roll. Thereafter, all attacks against displacers will be at a penalty of -2 to the attack roll. This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind.

<p>A triceratops is a three-horned herbivorous dinosaur. They are aggressive toward interlopers, attacking anyone who might appear to be a threat. Individuals are quite large, weighing 11,000 to 20,000 pounds and ranging from 26 to 30 feet in length.</p>
<p>When facing opponents of smaller size, a triceratops will usually attempt to trample them, reserving the gore attack for larger opponents. Up to two adjacent man- sized or up to four smaller opponents may be trampled simultaneously; the triceratops rolls a single attack roll which is compared to the Armor Class of each of the potential victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll for each one successfully hit. The gore attack may only be used against a single man-sized or larger creature, but may be used in the same round as the trample if the creature being gored is larger than man sized. Also note that a charging bonus may be applied to the gore attack.</p>

<p>The tyrannosaurus rex is a bipedal carnivorous dinosaur with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, its forelimbs are short but unusually powerful for their size, with two clawed digits. Despite this, they are not used to attack, as the tyrannosaur’s powerful bite is its preferred weapon.</p>
<p>Individuals can grow to lengths of over 40 feet and can weigh up to 20,000 pounds, though most are a bit smaller than this, averaging around 35 feet in length and 17,000 pounds in weight.</p>
<p>The statistics above can also be used to represent other large bipedal carnosaurs, such as the allosaurus.</p>

<p>The djinn (singular djinni) are humanoid creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air. A djinni in its natural form is about 10½ feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind (see below) to harass those who follow; the 12 morale reflects a djinni’s absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the “8” figure to determine whether an outmatched djinn decides to leave a combat.</p>
<p>Djinn have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures):&nbsp;<strong>create food and drink</strong>, creating tasty and nourishing food for up to 2d6 humans or similar creatures, once per day; become&nbsp;<strong>invisible</strong>, with unlimited uses per day;&nbsp;<strong>create normal items</strong>, creating up to 1,000 pounds of soft goods or wooden items of permanent nature or metal goods lasting at most a day, once per day; assume&nbsp;<strong>gaseous form</strong>, as the potion, up to one hour per day; and&nbsp;<strong>create illusions</strong>, as the spell&nbsp;<strong>phantasmal force</strong>&nbsp;but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day.</p>
<p>Djinn may assume the form of a whirlwind at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; a djinni in whirlwind form fights as if it were an air elemental.</p>
<p>Due to their highly magical nature, djinn cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal cold, and suffer only half damage from magical attacks based on either cold or wind.</p>

<p>Normal dogs include most medium and large breeds, including wild dogs. After biting an opponent, a dog can hold on, doing 1d4 damage automatically every round, until killed or until the victim spends an attack breaking free (which requires a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray, adjusted by the character’s Strength bonus).</p>
<p>Riding dogs are a large breed, used primarily by Halflings for transport. They may be trained for war, and equipped with barding to improve their Armor Class. They can maintain a hold in the same way that normal dogs do. A light load for a riding dog is up to 150 pounds; a heavy load, up to 300 pounds.</p>

<p>Dopplegangers are weird humanoid creatures who are able to take on the appearance of nearly any other humanoid ranging from 3 feet up to 7 feet in height. They can also read minds (as the spell, <strong>mind reading</strong>, but with unlimited duration), an ability that can even be used to speak any language known to the creature whose mind is being read. In their natural form (which few creatures ever see) they are pale and pasty looking, slim, around 5½ feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. Their features look unformed and incomplete.</p>
<p>Dopplegangers wish to live a life of ease, and in pursuit of that goal they will seek to take the place of any character they meet who they believe can help them get that kind of life. This usually means separating the victim from any allies and quietly killing them. While a doppleganger can duplicate the appearance of the clothing and equipment worn by a creature, such items are part of the creature and cannot, for example, be laid down or handed to someone. Taking the clothing and equipment of a victim is thus the preferred tactic.</p>
<p>A doppleganger can mimic the sound of the voice of any living creature as well as the appearance of any humanoid. Their <strong>mind reading</strong> ability will be used to help them behave like the person they have replaced.</p>

<section id="dragon" class="level2 monster" data-tag="Dragon">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dragon">Dragon</h2>
<p>Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish “true” dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven “age categories,” ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.</p>
<p>If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.</p>
<p>In combat dragons use a powerful bite, slashing claws, a long, whiplike tail, and most famously some form of breath weapon. Tactically, dragons prefer to fight while flying, making passes over ground-based enemies to strike or breathe on them. Smarter and older dragons will look for the toughest or most dangerous foe to strike down first, particularly preferring to eliminate magic-users as early in a fight as possible.</p>
<p>Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail in the same round. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.</p>
<p>The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.</p>
<p>There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon’s breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a “normal” shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM’s option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon can produce all three shapes.</p>
<p>The shapes are:</p>
<p><strong>Cone Shaped:</strong> The breath weapon begins at the dragon’s mouth, and is about 2’ wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon’s type and age).</p>
<p><strong>Line Shaped:</strong> The breath weapon is 5’ wide (regardless of the given width figure) and extends the given length in a straight line.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Shaped:</strong> The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, any length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20’ deep or high.</p>
<p>All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of “talking;” this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or some other humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for “talking” is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.</p>
<p>Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.</p>
<p>All dragons crave wealth, hoarding as many coins, gems, items of jewelry, and best of all magic items in their lair as possible. The greater a dragon’s hoard, the less it will seek to leave its lair, though of course it must hunt for food from time to time. Dragons rarely trust any other creature to defend their hoard, though some will entice aggressive but unintelligent creatures to live nearby in the hopes that they will kill and eat any thieves who might come nosing around.</p>
<p>Unlike other monsters, multiple dragons encountered in a lair together do not share treasure; generate a full treasure for each dragon individually. Treasure for dragons is special, as noted on the treasure section . The odds of monetary treasure increase with the monster’s age category, while the chances of gems, jewelry, and magic items are based upon its hit dice.</p>
<p>Young dragons typically have brightly colored, glossy skin; as a dragon ages, both the color and the sheen slowly become dull. Experience Points (XP) given for dragons on the following pages are for non-spell-casting dragons of age category 4. The GM must calculate the XP award for any specific dragon as given in the <a href="./advancement.html#experience-points-xp">character advancement section</a>, adding a special ability bonus (i.e.&nbsp;a “star”) if the dragon casts spells.</p>

<p>Cloud dragons have the most varied appearance of all the true dragons. In an indoor environment or when underground a cloud dragon appears to be a bright metallic color, while outdoors their coloration is brighter and less metallic, and may take on a reddish or bluish cast reminiscent of a sunrise or sunset. Hatchlings have a coppery skin tone, brightening to silver at the second age category, then to gold at the fourth before fading to a platinum tone by age category 6. While most true dragons become duller in color and sheen as they age, cloud dragons do not.</p>
<p>Cloud dragons are not cruel and do not seek to kill for pleasure. Many tales are told of cloud dragons offering assistance to adventurers, though they are every bit as avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold need not bother asking for a loan.</p>
<p>Another way in which cloud dragons differ from other types is that they do not have fixed breath weapons. Upon reaching the second age category, a cloud dragon acquires the breath weapon of a randomly-chosen (or GM assigned) dragon type; upon reaching the fourth age category, they acquire a second breath weapon type. Cloud dragons possess the same immunities as the dragons whose breath weapons they reproduce.</p>
<p>All cloud dragons have the power to assume the form of any type of humanoid (as described in the spell&nbsp;<a href="./allSpells.html#charm-person">charm person</a>) at will in a manner otherwise equivalent to the spell&nbsp;<a href="./allSpells.html#polymorph-self">polymorph self</a>.</p>

<p>Desert dragons have rough, gritty-feeling hide which is a dark steel blue color with a smoother, streaky brown underbelly. Their bodies are wiry and serpentine.</p>
<p>They hunt by day in the heat of the sun, sometimes flying high overhead looking for prey, or sometimes choosing to bury themselves in the sand and lie in wait with only eyes and nostrils exposed. One will wait in this fashion until victims come within 100 feet, then spring out and attack (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>
<p>A desert dragon will usually choose to lair in an underground cavern, or perhaps in a ruined castle or desert outpost. They are evil monsters, though not so fierce as mountain dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a desert dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person as a cat plays with a mouse.</p>
<p>Desert dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.</p>

<p>Forest dragons are bright leaf green in color, with a tan underbelly. They have long sinuous bodies and move with catlike grace. They are cruel monsters, but they are renowned for their curiosity. They especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby. Adventurers may be allowed to live so long as they remain interesting… but woe to them when the dragon becomes bored.</p>
<p>Forest dragons are immune to all poisons. Note that, despite their breath weapon being described as “poison gas,” damage done by it is exactly the same as with other dragons. More specifically, those in the area of effect do not have to “save or die” as with ordinary poison, but rather save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath for half damage.</p>

<p>Ice dragons have pale blue-white skin, ranging from sky blue for a hatchling to the stark pure white of an ancient individual. They are the same color all over, having no contrasting underbelly color.</p>
<p>They prefer to live in cold regions, whether in the highest mountains or in the cold northern lands. They are the least intelligent of dragons, though this does not mean that they are stupid by any stretch of the imagination. They are motivated completely by a drive to live, to reproduce, and (of course) to accumulate treasure; they kill to live, not for pleasure.</p>
<p>In a fashion similar to swamp and desert dragons, an ice dragon will sometimes choose to bury itself in snow and wait, with only its eyes and nostrils exposed, in a place where prey is likely to pass by. The ice dragon will then burst out when likely prey approaches within 100’, surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6.</p>
<p>Ice dragons are immune to normal cold, and take only half damage from magical cold or ice.</p>

<p>Mountain dragons are red in color, ranging from the brilliant blood red of a hatchling to the dull terracotta color of an ancient individual. These dragons are powerfully built, with heavy-jawed heads and thick muscular bodies, yet their necks are still long enough to give them the legendary flexibility of a true dragon.</p>
<p>They are cruel monsters, actively seeking to hunt, torment, kill and consume intelligent creatures. They are often said to prefer women and elves, but in truth a mountain dragon will attack almost any creature less powerful than itself.</p>
<p>They are intelligent and self-assured, but also impatient and overconfident. One will often plan strategies in advance and then choose one at random when facing unknown opponents, without regard to whether or not the strategy is likely to work. The sheer power of a mountain dragon is often the only reason one is still alive.</p>
<p>Mountain dragons are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire.</p>

<p>Plains dragons are the smallest of the true dragons. They have yellow skin dappled with light green patches, spots, or sometimes thin stripes. The color dulls and darkens with age until it reaches an almost uniform tan color at the oldest age category. They have long sinuous bodies and unusually long legs, giving them the fastest land movement rate of any dragon, but they are also accomplished fliers, as fast and maneuverable as any dragon.</p>
<p>Plains dragons may hunt on the wing, attacking suddenly from above and surprising on 1-3 on 1d6; or, they may lie in wait in tall grass or a copse of trees, using their coloration as camouflage. As one ages and its colors dull, this ability improves; when lying in wait, they gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 at age categories 2 and 3, on 1-4 in age categories 4 through 6, and on 1-5 at age category 7.</p>
<p>The breath weapon of the plains dragon is a scorching, shimmering cone of heat, barely visible to the naked eye; at night, however, a glow like steel being forged can be seen streaming from the dragon’s open mouth.</p>

<p>Young sea dragons are light bluish-gray in color (similar to dolphins), darkening to a deep slate color in older individuals. Their skin is smooth and sleek, and their bodies are more compact than most dragons, though their long neck gives them the same flexibility.</p>
<p>Though they live in the water and are somewhat adapted to it, sea dragons still must breathe air, similar to dolphins or whales. A sea dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while swimming or performing other moderate activity.</p>
<p>These dragons have much the same physical structure as other dragons, but their feet are webbed and their tails are short, flat and broad; these adaptations help the sea dragon swim efficiently, but severely limit their ability to walk on dry land. Unlike other dragons, sea dragons do not have a tail attack. The breath weapon of a sea dragon is a cloud of steam; they are immune to damage from non-magical steam (including the breath weapon of another sea dragon), and suffer only half damage from magical steam attacks.</p>
<p>Sea dragons are neutral in outlook, in much the same way as ice dragons. They often maintain lairs in air-filled undersea caverns.</p>

<p>Swamp dragons have green skin so dark as to appear to be black, especially in uncertain light or while wet. They often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100’ (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).</p>
<p>Though swamp dragons are more cruel than ice dragons, they are still motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items.</p>
<p>Swamp dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A swamp dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while lying in wait underwater.</p>

<p>Dryads are female nature spirits; each is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad’s oak does not radiate magic. A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.</p>
<p>A dryad’s delicate features are much like a female elf’s, though her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons. Although they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been encountered in one place on rare occasions.</p>
<p>Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are alluring – they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad can charm (as the spell&nbsp;<strong>charm person</strong>), attempting to gain control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.</p>

<p>Eagles are large birds with wingspans 6½ to 7½ feet in width. They stand about 2½ to 3 feet tall and weigh about 13 lbs. These birds have heavy talons and large beaks with a sharp hooked end. Eagles are known to carry prey up to 15 lbs. An eagle will also kill and start to eat animals that are 5 times the eagles size, up to 80 lbs. The largest eagles tend to be fish-eating or sea eagles, while other types of eagles will eat snakes or small animals. Coloring is dependent on the species of eagle from dark browns with a white head, to fully brown, to various grays ranging from black to white. The beaks can be bright yellowish orange to black. Eagles will fly at a prey and attack with both sets of talons, then attack with the beak.</p>

<p>An average giant eagle has a wingspan of 15 to 20 feet and stands 8 to 12 feet tall. They are intelligent creatures, and many speak Common or another language common in their home territory.</p>
<p>Individual giant eagles are rarely encountered alone, as they prefer to live in loose communities. However, when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with each eagle choosing a single creature as prey. As they can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more easily choose a victim.</p>
<p>Giant eagles mate for life. If a nest with eggs or hatchlings is threatened, both parents will fight without checking morale, and other giant eagles in their community may come to their defense but will still seek to scatter any opponents so as to attack them one on one</p>

<p>The efreet (singular efreeti) are humanoid creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire. An efreeti in its natural form stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Efreet are malicious by nature. They love to mislead, befuddle, and confuse their foes. They do this for enjoyment as much as for tactical reasons.</p>
<p>Note that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti’s absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the “9” figure to determine whether an outmatched efreeti decides to leave a combat.</p>
<p>Efreet have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): become&nbsp;<strong>invisible</strong>, with unlimited uses per day; assume&nbsp;<strong>gaseous form</strong>, as the potion, up to one hour per day;&nbsp;<strong>create illusions</strong>, as the spell&nbsp;<strong>phantasmal force</strong>&nbsp;but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day;&nbsp;<strong>create flame</strong>, with unlimited uses; and create a&nbsp;<strong>wall of fire</strong>&nbsp;(as the spell), once per day. Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torchflame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60’, causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit. The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well if desired, once per round.</p>
<p>Efreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.</p>
<p>Due to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire attacks.</p>

<section id="elemental" class="level2 monster" data-tag="Elemental*">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="elemental">Elemental*</h2>
<p>An elemental is a being formed from one of the foundational elements of reality. In Western traditions, the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water; Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. This book presents the full range needed for either tradition, and to those types are added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish to be less traditional. As always, the Game Master decides what sort of monsters appear in their world, and so not all of the following creatures may be encountered.</p>
<p>Each type of elemental may be summoned to the material plane by means of one of three different methods:</p>
<p>Conjured by the 5th level Magic-User spell <a href="./allSpells.html#conjure-elemental">conjure elemental</a>; or,</p>
<p>Summoned by means of a magical <strong>staff</strong>; or,</p>
<p>Summoned by a device (as given in the <a href="./magicItems.html#miscellaneous-magic-items">Miscellaneous Magic</a> subsection of the Treasure section of this book.</p>
<p>These three types of elementals are quite reasonably called staff, device, and conjured elementals. The hit dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Type</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Device</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Conjured</td>
<td>16</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it to control it, and may take no other action, including attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be lost. Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the summoner and attack.</p>
<p>Elementals must be summoned from a large quantity of the appropriate natural material. For example, air elementals require a large quantity of air (so small underground spaces will not support the summoning of one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work). Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other elemental of the same type may be summoned in the same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.</p>
<p>Non-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental. Attacks made by an elemental should be considered magical for purposes of determining how much damage creatures resistant to the elemental’s attack form should suffer.</p>
<p>Generally, elementals are immune to both normal and magical forms of their own attack form. Most are more susceptible to attacks from one or two specific other types of elemental; this is noted in the text for each type.</p>

<p>Air elementals resemble “dust devils,” that is, small whirlwinds, but they are much more powerful. Air elementals take double damage when attacked by earth-based attacks (including by earth elementals). An air elemental may choose either to attack a single opponent, thus receiving one attack per round at the listed damage, or may choose to knock all opponents in a 5’ radius to the ground; if the latter attack is used, all creatures of 2 hit dice or less must save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray or fall prone. Creatures of 3 or more levels or hit dice are not so affected. Air elementals do an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures or vehicles which are airborne.</p>

<p>A cold elemental resembles a crude, headless ice statue with long sharp icicles in place of hands. A cold elemental suffers double damage from fire attacks, including the attacks of fire elementals. It deals an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures that are hot or flaming in nature, as well as creatures made of liquids or jelly. A cold elemental’s body is so bitterly cold that creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of damage automatically, unless they are immune to the effects of cold. Any liquids the cold elemental touches immediately freeze solid. A cold elemental cannot enter places where the temperature is above 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and if forced to do so will suffer 1d6 points of damage each round.</p>

<p>Fire elementals are simply flames, which may appear generally humanoid for brief moments when they attack. Fire elementals take double damage when attacked by water (including water elementals). They cannot cross a body of water wider than their own diameter. They do an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures which are cold or icy in nature.</p>
<p>Remember that a fire elemental is constantly burning; such a creature may easily start fires if it moves into an area containing items which burn easily, such as dry wood, paper, or oil. No specific rules are given for such fires, but the GM is directed to the rules for burning oil for an example of fire damage.</p>

<p>A lightning elemental resembles dark clouds lit from within by flashes of lightning. One can magnetically draw metal items towards itself as if using <a href="./allSpells.html#telekinesis">telekinesis</a>. It deals 1d8 extra points of damage to creatures that are in contact with water or metal but not touching solid ground. A lightning elemental takes double damage when attacked by air or wind attacks (including air elementals), and from the attacks of wood elementals as well. A lightning elemental can choose either to strike a single creature or create a mighty thunderclap. If the latter attack is used, all creatures within a 30 foot radius must save vs.&nbsp;Paralysis or be deafened for 1d8 turns</p>

<p>Metal elementals appear to be somewhat abstract humanoid figures formed from metal. They are able to move as if liquid, though they are cool and hard to the touch. Their semi-liquid form permits them to form their extremities into wickedly sharp blades, which is their preferred means of attack. Those wearing metal armor receive no protection against a metal elemental (except for magical bonuses, if any); indeed, on a successful hit one deals an additional 1d8 points of damage to creatures, vehicles, or structures that are made of or in direct contact with some form of metal. Lightning attacks deal double damage to a metal elemental. Like an earth elemental, a metal elemental cannot cross a body of water greater than its own height.</p>

<p>Falcons are birds with wingspans of 16 to 20 inches; they stand about 1.5 to 2 feet tall and weigh about 3 pounds. These are the most popular of the hunting birds used by royalty. Falcons can only carry prey up to 1 pound. They will hunt snakes, small rodents, and even other birds such as wild ducks. Falcons appear in a variety of colors, typically ranging from dark gray on top to white with dark stripes on the bottom; kestrels, a variety of falcon, have reddish brown to dark brown feathers with dark stripes. A falcon typically attacks prey by diving, striking first with the talons before making the kill with its sharp beak.</p>

<p>Barracuda are predatory fish found in salt water. Huge barracudas are about 12’ long, while giant specimens can exceed 20’. They have elongated bodies, pointed heads and prominent jaws. Their bodies are covered with smooth scales, typically blue, gray or silver in color. They have extremely keen eyesight and are surprised only on a 1 on 1d6. Due to the quickness of their attack, barracudas are themselves capable of surprising on 1-3 on 1d6 and gain a +2 bonus to Initiative.</p>
<p>Giant barracudas always appear singly and are 50% likely to break off the attack after 1d4 rounds if they haven’t killed their prey. Both kinds are attracted to shiny objects.</p>

<p>Giant bass are predatory, and on a natural attack roll of 20 a giant bass will swallow whole a dwarf-sized or smaller creature, which then takes 2d4 damage per round until it is dead. Swallowed characters can attack only with daggers or similar short weapons. Note that each giant bass can swallow at most one character, and a giant bass which has swallowed a character will attempt to retreat (having achieved its goal).</p>

<p>Giant catfish fins are edged with a natural poison that causes a painful burning sensation for 3d10 rounds if a save vs.&nbsp;Poison is failed. The pain causes the affected character or creature to suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws; further poisonings will increase this penalty by -1 each, down to a maximum penalty of -5 as well as adding 6 rounds to the duration of the poison effect.</p>
<p>Because of its large size (15 to 20 feet long) and body design, a giant catfish cannot target more than one of its attacks on any single creature; that is, it cannot bite and fin the same opponent, nor use both fins on one victim.</p>

<p>Giant frogs are enlarged versions of the common frog; most resemble bullfrogs in appearance, but an adult giant frog is 3’ long and weighs about 250 pounds. They are predators, but will normally only attack creatures smaller than themselves. Giant toads are statistically just like giant frogs; however, they are often found in “drier” areas as they do not have to maintain a wet skin surface.</p>
<p>A giant frog can stretch its tongue out up to 15’ and drag up to dwarf-sized prey to its mouth; on every subsequent round, the victim is hit automatically. On a natural 20 attack roll, the victim is swallowed whole, taking 1d6 damage per round thereafter. Each giant frog can swallow only one such victim.</p>

<p>Gargoyles are demonic-looking winged humanoid monsters with gray stone-like skin. They are often mistaken for winged stone statues, for they can remain still indefinitely without moving. Gargoyles use this disguise to ambush their foes, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 if their foes do not otherwise suspect them. They are cruel monsters, inflicting pain on other creatures for the sole purpose of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Gargoyles require no food, water, or air. Due to their highly magical nature, they can only be harmed by magical weapons.</p>

<p>The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash. Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside the cube’s body. A typical gelatinous cube is ten feet on a side and weighs about 15,000 pounds; however, smaller specimens have been reported.</p>
<p>A gelatinous cube attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It is capable of lashing out with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs foes. Any character hit by a gelatinous cube must save vs.&nbsp;Paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d4 turns.</p>
<p>Any treasure indicated will be visible inside the creature, which must be slain if the treasure is to be recovered.</p>

<p>Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost normally resembles the form it had in life, but sometimes the spiritual form is altered. For instance, the ghost of someone who believed he or she was evil might look a bit demonic. Because they are incorporeal, ghosts may be hit only by magical weapons.</p>
<p>Seeing a ghost is so terrible that the victim must save vs.&nbsp;Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. A character or creature who successfully saves vs.&nbsp;a given ghost’s&nbsp;<strong>fear</strong>&nbsp;attack may not be so affected by that ghost again, but of course may still be affected by another.</p>
<p>A ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8 points of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same number of hit points. In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit. Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the GM should assign whatever score he or she sees fit.</p>
<p>Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of&nbsp;<strong>restoration</strong>; nothing else (except a&nbsp;<strong>wish</strong>) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character’s Constitution falls to 0, he or she dies permanently and cannot be&nbsp;<strong>raised</strong>&nbsp;(but still may be&nbsp;<strong>reincarnated</strong>).</p>
<p>Once per turn, a ghost can use&nbsp;<strong>telekinesis</strong>&nbsp;(as the spell) as if it were a 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;level Magic-User.</p>
<p>Instead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living creature. This ability is similar to a&nbsp;<strong>magic jar</strong>&nbsp;spell (as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be able to move into the target (so it is possible to outrun it). The target can resist the attack with a successful save vs.&nbsp;Spells. A creature that successfully saves is immune to being possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the save fails, the ghost enters the target’s body and controls it; control may be maintained until the ghost chooses to leave the victim’s body, or until it is driven out by means of a&nbsp;<strong>remove curse</strong>&nbsp;spell. While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not use any of its special abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Ghouls</strong> are <strong>undead</strong> monsters which eat the flesh of dead humanoids to survive. They are vile, disgusting carrion-eaters, but are more than willing to kill for food. Those slain by ghouls will generally be stored until they begin to rot before the ghouls will actually eat them.</p>
<p>Living creatures hit by a ghoul’s bite or claw attack must save vs.&nbsp;Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns. Elves are immune to this paralysis. Ghouls try to attack with surprise whenever possible, striking from behind tombstones or bursting from shallow graves; when they attack in this way, they are able to surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. Like all undead, they may be <a href="./combat.html#turning-the-undead">Turned</a> by Clerics and are immune to <a href="./allSpells.html#sleep">sleep</a>, <a href="./allSpells.html#charm-person">charm</a>, and <a href="./allSpells.html#hold-person">hold</a> magics.</p>
<p>Humanoids bitten by ghouls may be infected with ghoul fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 5% chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.</p>
<p>An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the knowledge or abilities they possessed in life. The newly-risen ghoul is not under the control of any other ghouls, but hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other ghoul in all respects.</p>
<p><strong>Ghasts</strong> look and fight almost exactly like ghouls, but they are smarter and just a bit more powerful. Refer to the previous paragraphs for information about their claw attacks and other abilities.</p>
<p>The stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a save vs.&nbsp;Poison or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A <a href="./allSpells.html#neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a> spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.</p>
<p>They may be Turned by Clerics using the same column as the ghoul, but as they are superior to ghouls, in a mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GM should apply Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.</p>
<p>Humanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10% chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.</p>
<p>An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a ghast at the next midnight, in a similar fashion to the ghoul. However, a humanoid who becomes a ghast in this way retains all of the knowledge and abilities they possessed in life, unless those abilities are directly incompatible with the creature’s new form (as decided by the GM). For such ghasts, the GM should also adjust XP values to include any such abilities. The newly-risen ghast is not under the control of any other ghasts, but hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other ghast in all respects.</p>

<p>Cloud giants’ skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky blue. They have hair of silvery white or brass, and their eyes are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.</p>
<p>Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite). Like most giants, they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand tribute from humans, demi-humans, or humanoids living nearby.</p>
<p>Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. Cloud giants can throw large stones up to 200’ for 3d6 points of damage each. Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 8 (2d4). A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells. In battle, cloud giants wear finely crafted, intricately engraved plate mail.</p>

<p>Mountain giants are the largest of all giants, with adult males averaging 24 feet in height and weighing around 16,000 pounds. Females are slightly smaller, standing 22 feet tall on the average and weighing around 14,000 pounds. They look very much like enormous, thickly built hill giants, and among humans they are often seen as little more than that. This is underselling the mountain giants, however, for though their crafting is primitive they have an intricately detailed social structure.</p>
<p>Mountain giants live in clans, led by the oldest male and female (or by their oldest offspring if the elders choose to delegate leadership due to advanced age). Each clan rules over and controls a group of 1d6 mountain peaks, generally spanning an area with a 5-6 mile diameter. They prefer peaks connected by high ridges so that they do not have to descend too far when walking their territory. Clan members who are mated establish households within the territory; unmarried members typically live with their parents until they are wed. The “lair” encounter figures above are for a single household, but if one household is attacked and the attackers subsequently retreat, upon their return they will usually find much of the rest of the clan waiting for them in ambush.</p>
<p>They wear armor made of wood held together with heavy rope, and wield giant clubs or staves carved from fully grown trees harvested from the lower reaches of their territory. If they live near storm giants, they may trade for better weapons (the second damage rating given above) but usually cannot afford storm giant armor.</p>
<p>A mountain giant can throw large stones up to 240’ for 4d6 points of damage each</p>

<p>Stone giants are not the largest of giants, but with an average adult standing 12 feet tall and weighing roughly 1,500 pounds they are still formidable. There is no substantial difference in height between males and females. They usually dress in heavy leather clothing with sections having been boiled to stiffen them; these outfits serve as armor and give them the first AC above. Stone giants are reclusive, but they will defend their territory (typically in rocky mountainous terrain) against any who trespass therein.</p>
<p>A stone giant can throw large stones up to 300’ for 3d6 points of damage. They will fight in groups to defend their territory but use only simple, basic tactics and strategy.</p>

<p>Adult storm giants are about 21 feet tall and weigh about 12,000 pounds. They can live to be 600 years old. Most storm giants have pale skin and dark hair. Very rarely, storm giants have violet skin. Violet-skinned storm giants have deep violet or blue-black hair with silvery gray or purple eyes.</p>
<p>Storm giants generally dress in short, loose tunic belted at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and a headband. They wear a few pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, anklets (favored by barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. They live quiet, reflective lives and spend their time musing about the world, composing and playing music, and tilling their land or gathering food.</p>
<p>Storm giants prefer to attack first with their&nbsp;<strong>lightning bolts</strong>&nbsp;(which work just as the spell does, and can be used once per five rounds; a save vs.&nbsp;Spells reduces damage to half). Also, 10% of storm giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 12 (2d6). In battle, they wear well-crafted and well-cared-for plate mail.</p>
<p>Unlike most other giants, storm giants have been known to befriend humans, elves, or dwarves.</p>

<p>Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose tribes. Most gnolls have dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. An adult male gnoll is about 7½ feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.</p>
<p>Gnolls are nocturnal, and have Darkvision with a 30’ range. They are cruel carnivores, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. They show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader.</p>
<p>One out of every six gnolls will be a hardened warrior of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. Gnolls gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by such a warrior. In lairs of 12 or greater, there will be a pack leader of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP) having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, gnolls never fail a morale check as long as the pack leader is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present, and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hardened warrior statistically, and in addition has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

<p>Gnomes stand 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Males usually wear short, carefully trimmed beards.</p>
<p>Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years. They have Darkvision with a 30’ range. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20% chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.</p>
<p>Gnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure.</p>
<p>Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the statistics above are for such. In the lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2 on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics and Magic-Users are equivalent to regular gnomish warriors statistically.</p>

<p>Goblins are small, wicked humanoids that favor ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge they can devise. An adult goblin stands 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Its eyes are usually bright and crafty-looking, varying in color from red to yellow. A goblin’s skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red; usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color. Goblins wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward drab, soiled-looking colors. They have Darkvision with a 30’ range.</p>
<p>The statistics given above are for a standard Goblin in leather armor with a shield; they have a natural Movement rate of 30’ and a natural Armor Class of 11.</p>
<p>Some goblins ride&nbsp;<strong>dire wolves</strong>&nbsp;into combat, and large groups of goblins will often employ them to track and attack their foes.</p>
<p>One out of every eight goblins will be a warrior of 3-3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Goblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In a lair or other settlement, one out of every fifteen will be a chieftain of 5-5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and movement of 10’ that gains a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs or settlements of 30 or more goblins, there will be a goblin king of 7-7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 16 (11), wearing chainmail and carrying a shield, with a movement of 10’, and having a +1 bonus to damage. Goblins have a +2 bonus to morale while their king is present (this is not cumulative with the bonus given by a warrior leader). In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a goblin king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular goblin statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.</p>

<section id="golem" class="level2 monster" data-tag="Golem*">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="golem">Golem*</h2>
<p>Golems are a kind of construct, a creature created from non-living matter and animated by application of magic. The powers required to animate a golem are prodigious, and involve summoning, capturing, and binding an elemental spirit to the constructed body. This process also binds the golem to the will of its creator.</p>
<p>They are mindless, and thus immune to magics affecting the mind such as sleep, charm, hold, and any form of mind reading or telepathy. They must be given explicit, detailed instructions verbally, and the controller must usually be within 60 feet of the golem to do so. If not actively being commanded, a golem will follow the last instructions given to it until the controller returns. If such a golem is attacked, it will fight in its own defense but will usually not pursue the attackers if they flee. The controller can order the golem to follow the commands of another, but can always resume control if desired (i.e.&nbsp;the controller’s commands always take precedence).</p>
<p>Employing a golem in combat is tricky, for once one attacks an opponent there is a cumulative 1% chance each round (so 1% the first round, 2% the second, 3% the third, and so on) that the golem will stop following commands and become berserk. Once this happens the golem will attack any creature in range, choosing targets randomly when there are more than one. If all targets are killed or driven away the golem will move on, looking for more creatures to kill and breaking down any barrier that stands in its way if it is at all possible.</p>
<p>The berserk chance for a golem that is still under control is reset to 0% only when the golem is inactive, neither attacking nor being attacked, for one full round.</p>
<p>The creator of the golem (but not any other person who might have been delegated control) may try to calm the golem, speaking firmly to it to convince it to stop. The creator needs to succeed at a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Spells to do this, after spending a round talking to the golem. If this roll fails the golem turns its attention to the creator and pursues them with single-minded hatred.</p>
<p>If a berserk golem is unable to attack anyone for 5 rounds it resumes its inactive state, and the controller can again give it commands. If it begins to pursue its creator, though, it will never stop no matter how long it takes, and must normally be trapped or destroyed to stop it. It has no special way to find the creator, however, and will become inactive if it loses sight of the creator for a minimum of 1 day. If the golem is successfully calmed, it can be given commands again on the very next round of combat.</p>
<p>As their bodies are made of non-living matter, golems can only be hit by magical weapons. Conversely, they are less resistant to various effects due to the fact that they are not living creatures; in general, golems save as if they were Fighters of ½ their hit dice in levels. For example, a Bone Golem has 8 hit dice, but saves as a Fighter of 4th level.</p>

<p>Bone golems are huge four-armed monsters created from the skeletons of at least two dead humanoids. Though made of bone, they are not undead and cannot be turned.</p>
<p>Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem can be armed with two two-handed weapons, giving 2 attacks per round and a damage figure of 1d10/1d10 or by weapon.</p>
<p>When a bone golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk.

<p>Flesh golems are horrible creations made of body parts from deceased humanoids (including all character races as well as humanoid monsters), crudely stitched together and animated by magic. A flesh golem is 8 feet tall and weighs about 450 pounds.</p>
<p>A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh golem (as the <a href="./allSpells.html#haste">slow</a> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. Attacks using lightning or electricity heal 1 point of damage per every 3 points the attack would normally inflict, rounded down; further, such an attack breaks any ongoing slow effect on the golem. As usual, healing will not increase the monster above its normal hit points. For example, a flesh golem hit by a <a href="./allSpells.html#lightning-bolt">lightning bolt</a> which should deal 14 points of damage instead receives up to 4 points of healing.</p>

<p>This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below), although it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.</p>
<p>Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which fills a 10-foot cube and persists for 1 round. Those within the area of effect must save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath or die. This ability can be used up to 3 times per day.</p>
<p>A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as the&nbsp;<a href="./allSpells.html#haste">slow</a>&nbsp;spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 full points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, the excess is ignored. For example, an iron golem hit by a fireball gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 19 points. An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster, suffering 2d6 points of damage for each hit (with no saving throw normally allowed).</p>

<p>This golem has a humanoid body made from stone. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its body is frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs.</p>
<p>Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful and difficult to harm. A stone golem can use a&nbsp;<a href="./allSpells.html#haste">slow</a>&nbsp;effect, as the spell, once every other round; a save vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed to resist. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration of 2d6 rounds.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="./allSpells.html#flesh-to-stone">stone to flesh</a>&nbsp;spell may be used to weaken the monster. The spell does not actually change the golem’s structure, but for one full round after being affected, the golem is vulnerable to normal weapons. The stone golem is allowed a save vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist this effect.</p>

<p>Wood golems are small constructs, not more than 4’ in height, and are crudely made. Being made of wood makes them vulnerable to fire-based attacks; thus, wood golems suffer one extra point of damage per die from fire; any saving throws against such effects are at a penalty of -2. They move stiffly, suffering a -1 penalty to Initiative.</p>

<p>Gorgons are magical monsters resembling cattle made of iron. Their breath can turn living creatures to stone; it covers an area 60’ long by 10’ wide, and can be used as many times per day as the monster has hit dice, but no more often than every other round. A save vs. Petrify is allowed to resist.</p>
<p>An adult male gorgon weights up to 4,500 pounds and can be as much as 7 feet tall at the shoulder and up to 9 feet long. Females (cows) will be a bit smaller, perhaps no more than 6 feet at the shoulder and 8 feet long with a weight of around 4,000 pounds. However, their combat statistics are much the same as the males. Any group of more than one gorgon will consist of one bull with the rest being cows</p>

<p>Griffons are large carnivorous creatures resembling lions with the head, foreclaws and wings of eagles. From nose to tail, an adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad, golden wings emerge from the creature’s back and span 25 feet or more. An adult griffon weighs about 500 pounds.</p>
<p>Griffons nest on high mountaintops, soaring down to feed on horses, the beast’s preferred prey. They hunt and travel in ocks. A Griffon will attack a horse over anything else, diving low to swipe with their claws. They are not above retreating and coming back later, when there may be less of a defense mounted.</p>
<p>Griffons can be trained as mounts if raised in captivity, but even in this case they may try to attack horses if any come within about 120’. Roll a morale check in this case; if the check is failed, the griffon will try to attack immediately. A light load for a griffon is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.</p>

<p>Hangman trees are horrible, semi-animate creatures that fertilize themselves with dead bodies. A hangman tree has four animated limbs that can wrap around the necks of living creatures that pass beneath, strangling for 1d6 points of damage per round. These limbs are arranged evenly around the tree in most cases, and generally no more than one limb can attack any single creature at a time.</p>
<p>The roots of this tree are also animated; they do not attack, but they do pull dead bodies below the surface of the ground for “digestion.”</p>

<p>A harpy looks like a giant vulture bearing the torso and face of a human female. They are able to attack with their claws as well as with normal weapons, but their most insidious ability is their song. When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than harpies) within a 300’ radius must succeed on a save vs.&nbsp;Spells or become&nbsp;<strong>charmed</strong>. The same harpy’s song cannot affect a creature that successfully saves again for 24 hours. A charmed victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area (through ame, off a cliff, or the like), that creature is allowed a second saving throw to resist the charm. Charmed creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within reach of the harpy offers no resistance to the monster’s attacks. The effect continues for as long as the harpy sings, and for one round thereafter.</p>

<p>Hellhounds are canine creatures sheathed in hellish flame. A typical hell hound stands 4½ feet high at the shoulder and weighs 120 pounds. They are native to another plane where they hunt in packs; sometimes powerful wizards or evil priests summon them for use as watchdogs. In addition to biting, each hellhound may breathe fire a number of times per day equal to its hit dice. In combat, one-third of the time (1-2 on 1d6) a hellhound will choose to breathe fire; otherwise it will attempt to bite. Roll each round to determine which attack form will be used.</p>
<p>A hellhound’s breath weapon is a cone of flame 10’ wide at the far end which is 10’ long for those with 3 or 4 hit dice, 20’ long for those with 5 or 6 hit dice, and 30’ long for the largest hellhounds. This breath weapon does 1d6 points of damage per each hit die of the hellhound to all within the area of effect; a successful saving throw vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath reduces damage to half normal.</p>
<p>Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice each has. If generating a group randomly, roll 1d6+1 for the hit dice of each, reading a total of 2 as 3. A hellhound has an Armor Class equal to 11 plus its hit dice.</p>

<p>Hippogriffs resemble large fying horses with the forefront of a bird of prey. A typical hippogriff is 9 feet long, has a wingspan of 20 feet, and weighs 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>A hippogriff avoids the territories and civilizations of other creatures, dwelling in extreme altitudes.&nbsp;<strong>Griffons</strong>&nbsp;sometimes prey upon them, and hippogriffs will generally attack griffons on sight if they have a numerical advantage.</p>
<p>Hippogriffs are omnivorous, entering combat only as defense, save for those times a griffon is met. They are prized as flying mounts since, unlike griffons, they are relatively safe around horses; note that it is still necessary to raise one in captivity in order to use it as a mount. A light load for a hippogriff is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.</p>

<p>Hobgoblins are larger cousins of goblins, being about the same size as humans. Their hair color ranges from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. They have dark orange or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblins’ eyes are yellowish or dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often blood red with black-tinted leather. Their weaponry is kept polished and in good repair. They wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields for armor. As with most goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30’ range.</p>
<p>Hobgoblins are cruel and calculating warriors, always looking to exploit those weaker than themselves. They have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics and are capable of carrying out sophisticated battle plans. Under the leadership of a skilled strategist or tactician, their discipline can prove a deciding factor. Hobgoblins hate elves and attack them first in preference over other opponents.</p>
<p>One out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Regular hobgoblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20’, having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), adding a shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11) (movement is still 20’) having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular hobgoblin, but has Magic-User abilities of level 1d6.</p>

<p>Hydras are reptile-like monsters with multiple heads. They are gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan underbelly. The eyes are amber and the teeth are yellow-white. Hydras are about 20 feet long and weigh about 4,000 pounds. They are bad-tempered and territorial, but not particularly cunning.</p>
<p>A hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however, most who fight them choose to strike at their heads. If a character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a particular head, and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be able to attack anymore. Such damage also applies to the monster’s total hit points, of course.</p>
<p>Some hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a swimming rate rather than walking in this case. A very few hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit a flame 10’ wide and 20’ long one time per head per day. This attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it is available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs.&nbsp;Dragon Breath reducing the amount by half.</p>

<p>Hyenas are doglike carnivores who exhibit some of the behaviors of canines but are not related. They not only hunt but also scavenge and steal meals. A hungry hyena will chew on anything that is even remotely tainted by blood, meat or other food traces. They will mostly be found in the same savanna-like environments where lions and zebras may be found. They can live in clans of up to a hundred individuals, though smaller groups are more common. They are among the favorite pets of gnolls, who may take them into regions where they are not normally found.</p>

<p>These ancient four legged predators are named for their tooth shape, and while they are not technically prehistoric hyenas, the statistics work for the giant prehistoric varieties of hyenas as well. Many varieties of hyenodons were smallish, sometimes no bigger than a common hyena, and the statistics for standard hyenas may be used for them. The above statistics are for the larger types of Hyenodons or giant varieties of Hyena. A notable feature is that their massively built skull features a long jaw (similar to that of a crocodile) full of teeth, with four great fangs.</p>

<p>An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit. In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to three 10’ cubes, though it is possible for a swarm to become more compact in order to move through a small doorway or narrow corridor. If the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10’ squares and the flying movement above is ignored.</p>
<p>Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm suffers 1d3 points of damage each round. Damage rolls are doubled if the victim is unarmored (for creatures which do not wear armor, any creature having less than Armor Class 15 is considered unarmored).</p>
<p>Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds if the character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to “ward off” the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in this case also damage is reduced to 1 point per round. If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round. Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be affected by a&nbsp;<strong>sleep</strong>&nbsp;spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from the victim(s) due to smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more round.</p>

<p>Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon them to perform specific tasks.</p>
<p>A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until the task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert its instructions accordingly.</p>
<p>Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A&nbsp;<a href="./allSpells.html#detect-invisible">detect invisible</a>&nbsp;spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud. Don’t forget to apply the standard penalty of -4 on the attack die when an invisible stalker is attacked by a creature which is unable to see it.</p>

<p>An ironbane resembles a large armadillo in its overall body plan, but has an anteater-like snout with a long flicking tongue, and long, strangely hare-like back legs which allow it to hop from place to place. When attacking or pursuing, the ironbane stands up on its hind legs, but when resting or moving slowly it folds them and walks on all four feet.</p>
<p>Like the more common rust monster (as found on page 138), the touch of any part of an ironbane’s body transforms metal objects into rust (or verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate). Non-magical metal attacked by an ironbane, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A non- magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons or armor lose one “plus” each time they make contact with the ironbane; this loss is permanent.</p>
<p>The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; thus, a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this.</p>
<p>Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to an ironbane and will be ignored. Silver and copper on the other hand are candy for this creature and one will pursue the tastiest-smelling adventurer in any party.</p>

<p>Jellies are strange creatures made of amorphous protoplasm. They are similar to tiny single-celled creatures such as a few wizards may have studied using magic, but far larger. Jellies are always completely non- intelligent, and are thus immune to <strong>sleep</strong> or <strong>charm</strong> magic as well as any form or <strong>mind reading</strong> or telepathy. Generally they also do not check morale, but simply move toward any potential meal and attack automatically.</p>

<p>Black jellies are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic matter, living or dead. They attack any creatures they encounter, lashing out with pseudopods or simply engulfing opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that help them catch and digest their prey.</p>
<p>If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with lightning or electricity, a black jelly suffers no injury, but will be split into two jellies; the GM should divide the original creature’s hit dice between the two however they see fit, with the limitation that neither pudding may have less than two hit dice. A two hit die black jelly is simply unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split further.</p>
<p>Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black jelly, but such an attack will paralyze the jelly for one round per die of damage the attack would normally cause. Other attack forms will affect a black jelly normally; the preferred method of killing one usually involves fire.</p>
<p>The typical black jelly measures 10 feet across and 2 feet thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black jellies of smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly as a result of the splitting described above.</p>

<p>The glass jelly travels slowly along dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash. Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside the jelly’s body. Glass jellies are huge, averaging 1,000 cubic feet and weighing as much as 20,000 pounds. The body of a glass jelly is more viscous than that of other jellies, and it tends to take on the shape of its surroundings such that one in a dungeon with 10’ wide corridors might have a shape similar to that of a cube, while one living in round sewer drains under a city would have a cylindrical or half-cylindrical shape.</p>
<p>If a glass jelly encounters a narrow place (a doorway, for example) it will need 2d4 rounds to push through the constriction and will have assumed a new shape after doing so; such a new shape will persist for twice as long as it took to pass the constriction before the monster begins to flow into a shape that fills the available space again.</p>
<p>Glass jellies move quietly, making a faint sucking or slurping sound if anyone thinks to listen. Combined with their transparency, they are able to surprise prey on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6. Worse, any living creature hit by a glass jelly must save vs.&nbsp;Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d4 turns in addition to suffering damage from its acid secretions.</p>
<p>Any treasure indicated will be visible inside the creature, which must be slain if the treasure is to be recovered.</p>

<p>Green jelly devours flesh and organic materials on contact and is even capable of dissolving metal given enough time. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter. It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and possible food) below. Green jelly cannot grow in sunlight; even the indirect sunlight of a dense forest will stunt it and prevent it from spreading, and direct sunlight will kill it outright within a turn.</p>
<p>On the first round of contact, the jelly can be scraped off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing the same damage to both the victim and the jelly). A cure disease spell will destroy a patch of green jelly. It does not harm stone or enchanted metal, but can dissolve normal metal or enchanted wood in a turn and normal wood in 2d4 rounds.</p>
<p>If not destroyed or scraped off within 6+1d4 rounds, the victim will be completely transformed into more green jelly; such a character or creature cannot be retrieved by any magic short of a wish.</p>

<p>Kobolds are small, dog-faced reptilian humanoids. A kobold is 2 to 2½ feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas. They aim to drive enemies into the traps, where other kobolds wait to pour flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin onto them. Kobolds have Darkvision with a range of 60’, and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of&nbsp;<strong>light</strong>&nbsp;spells. Kobolds typically wear leather armor in battle.</p>
<p>One out of every six kobolds will be a warrior of 1 Hit Dice (25 XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP) with an Armor Class of 14 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP) who wears chain mail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 10’, and who has a +1 bonus to damage. In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular kobold statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.</p>
<p>Kobolds are cunning foes. They see all larger races as enemies, and are thus likely to be hostile when encountered. However, they are naturally cowardly, and prefer to avoid combat, leading enemies into ambushes or traps rather than facing them directly. Sometimes kobold tribes build and inhabit extensive dungeon areas filled with deadly traps which only they know how to avoid.</p>

<p>The lion is a large cat found in grasslands and savannas. They have muscular, broad-chested bodies, short, rounded heads, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. Adult male lions are larger than females, and in most varieties have a prominent mane. They live in social groups called prides consisting of a few adult males, several related females, and their cubs.</p>
<p>Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates; any hunting group of 1 or 2 is 80% likely to be females, and any group of 3 or more almost certainly are. Sometimes male lions are rogues, living outside a pride, and in those cases they may hunt as individuals or in pairs.</p>
<p>Lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans. Injured or obviously vulnerable humans may be too much of a temptation though.</p>

<p>Monitor lizards are generally dark in color, but often have bright, colorful, lace-like patterns covering their skin. A monitor may rise up onto its hind legs to run at a rate of 60 feet per round; such movement must be in a straight line, ending with the creature on all fours again. However, unlike a “double move” running movement, the monitor may still attack after moving.</p>
<p>Large monitor lizards range from 4 to 7 feet in length, and include such creatures as the so-called Komodo Dragon. Their venom is slow; those who are bitten must save vs.&nbsp;Poison at +2, with failure resulting in the victim suffering 1d6 points of damage each turn for 2d4 turns.</p>
<p>Huge monitors range from 8 to 11 feet in length. Their venom works faster than that of their smaller brethren; those bitten must save vs.&nbsp;Poison at +2 or suffer 1d6 points of damage each round for 2d4 rounds.</p>
<p>Giant monitor lizards range from 12 to 15 feet in length. Those bitten by a giant monitor must save vs.&nbsp;Poison at +2 or die.</p>
<p>All monitors are carnivores who hunt by running down their prey, and anything smaller than a monitor is considered prey.</p>

<p><strong>Common lizard men</strong> are tall, generally 6 to 7 feet tall at adulthood and weighing up to 250 pounds. Males and females are basically the same size, and it is quite difficult for other races to tell them apart. Due to their great Strength they always receive a +1 to damage done with melee weapons. They wear leather armor and carry shields in battle.</p>
<p>Lizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for an extended period of time (up to a full turn). They cannot swim while wearing armor; however, they often hide in the water even while armored, standing on the bottom with just nose and eyes exposed (similar to a crocodile). When they are able to employ this maneuver, lizard men surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.</p>
<p>Lizard men are largely indifferent to other races, being primarily interested in their own survival. If aroused, however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple but sound tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Subterranean lizard men</strong>, also called troglodytes, are superficially very similar to the common variety. Their skin is paler, and their eyes are red and seem to glow in low light conditions. Individuals are shorter than the common variety, standing just 5 to 6 feet tall, due in part to their somewhat “hunched” stance. They weigh about as much as the common type.</p>
<p>These monsters can change color at will, allowing them to blend into underground environments so well that they gain surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6. Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills.</p>
<p>Subterranean lizard men secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard character races) find the scent repulsive, and those within 10 feet of one must make a saving throw versus poison. Those failing the save suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain within 10 feet of the creature. Getting out of range negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates the penalty without an additional saving throw. The results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after which a new save must be rolled.</p>

<p>Lycanthropes are humans who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other human, though those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.</p>
<p>Lycanthropy is spread like a disease. Any human who loses half or more of his or her hit points due to lycanthrope bite and/or claw attacks will subsequently contract the same form of lycanthropy in 3d6 days. For demi-humans and humanoids, contracting the disease is fatal in the same time period. A&nbsp;<strong>cure disease</strong>&nbsp;cast before the onset is complete will stop the progress of the disease, but once the time has elapsed, the transformation is permanent.</p>
<p>When first infected, most lycanthropes cannot control their changes and will transform when stressed or under some other type-specific circumstances. After around two to three years, they gain the ability to change at will, and may attempt to resist involuntary transformation by means of a saving throw vs. Paralysis.</p>
<p>In animal form, lycanthropes may be hit only by silver or magical weapons.</p>

<p>Wereboars gain full control of their transformations quickly, needing only about a year to achieve mastery. They have just two forms, that of a human and that of a particularly large wild boar or sow.</p>
<p>In human form they tend to have “piggish” features such as gluttony and cunning, as well as an often strong physical resemblance to swine. Wereboars usually dislike both hard work and responsibility, but they are bullies who enjoy being in charge. They are easily bored with mundane things but are excited by violence (whether witnessing it or participating in it).</p>

<p>A wererat in human form tends to be a thin, wiry individual of shorter than average height, with eyes constantly darting around. A wererat’s nose and mouth may twitch if he or she is excited. Males often wear thin, ragged mustaches.</p>
<p>In addition to assuming the form of a giant rat, wererats can assume an intermediate form (a “ratman”). The ratman form shares the animal form’s immunity to normal weapons, and can deliver an identical bite, but in this form the wererat may use a normal weapon instead of biting. Note that the wererat in ratman form cannot bite and use a weapon in the same round.</p>
<p>Unlike most lycanthropes, wererats prefer to inhabit civilized areas, particularly cities. They frequently lair in sewers or other underground areas, coming out by night to steal from or kill city folk.</p>

<p>Manticores look like an overgrown lion with thick leathery wings and an ugly humanoid face, often like that of a human or bearded dwarf. Their tail ends in an assortment of spikes, which the beast may fire as projectiles; a maximum of 24 are available, and the manticore regrows 1d6 per day. A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Manticores are vicious predators, having a preference for human flesh. They will use their ranged attacks to “soften up” potential prey before closing to melee.</p>

<p><strong>Mammoths</strong> are huge, shaggy prehistoric relatives of the elephant. Though found in a variety of climates, they are most common in colder territories.</p>
<p>Like elephants, mammoths have five distinct attack modes (two tusks, a trunk grab, and two tramples with the front feet), but a single individual can apply no more than two of these attacks to any single opponent of small or medium size; large opponents may be targeted by three of these attacks in a round. However, one can attack multiple opponents in its immediate area at the same time.</p>
<p>A light load for a mammoth is 8,500 pounds; a heavy load, up to 17,000 pounds.</p>
<p>A mammoth has no treasure as such, but its tusks are worth 2d6 x 100 gp.</p>
<p><strong>Mastodons</strong> are a related species found in more temperate climates. These prehistoric relatives of the elephant are intelligent and able to communicate with each other in a rudimentary way. They are more aggressive than the common elephant and will attack any creature they see as a threat.</p>
<p>They have the same basic attack modes as mammoths, with the same limitations as given above.</p>
<p>A light load for a mastodon is 8,000 pounds; a heavy load, up to 16,000 pounds.</p>
<p>A mastodon has no treasure as such, but its tusks are worth 1d10 x 100 gp.</p>

<p>A medusa appears to be a human female with vipers growing from her head instead of hair. The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it unless a save vs.&nbsp;Petrification is made. In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC. It is safe to view a medusa’s reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs.&nbsp;Petrification itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.</p>
<p>Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).</p>
<p>A medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human.</p>
<p>Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain. They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can without being discovered.</p>

<p>Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of dolphins. Also called “sirens,” mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or other men found near the sea. They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.</p>
<p>A mermaid’s song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs.&nbsp;Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid’s temperament.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.</p>
<p>Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a pod.</p>
<p>One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.</p>
<p>A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only in groups of 1 or 2.</p>
<p>Mermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some Clerical abilities.</p>

<p>Minotaurs are huge bull-headed humanoid monsters. A minotaur stands more than 7 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds. Most minotaurs are very aggressive, and fly into a murderous rage if provoked or hungry. Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. They never become lost, and can track enemies with 85% accuracy. They gain +2 to damage when using melee weapons due to their great Strength. Minotaurs often wear toughened hides for armor.</p>

<p>Nixies are small water fairies. As far as anyone knows, all nixies are female. Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. They often twine shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed. Nixies prefer not to leave their lakes. A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45 pounds.</p>
<p>Ten or more nixies can work together to cast a powerful charm (similar to&nbsp;<strong>charm person</strong>). The charm lasts one year (unless dispelled). A save vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed to resist. Each nixie can cast&nbsp;<strong>water breathing</strong> once per day, with a duration of one day. Finally, a group of nixies will often have a school of giant bass living nearby who can be called to their aid (see&nbsp;<strong>Fish, Giant Bass</strong>&nbsp;for details).</p>
<p>Nixies are fey creatures, and thus unpredictable. However, they are rarely malicious, attacking only when they feel threatened.</p>

<p>The giant octopus is, obviously, an enormous version of the normal creature. They are physically powerful as well as being clever, which makes them a serious threat to seagoing vessels.</p>
<p>In order to bite a creature, the giant octopus must hit with at least two tentacles first. Further, any time a giant octopus hits with at least one tentacle per each 100 pounds of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it; unless the victim can find a way to resist (using whatever method the player might think of and whatever rolls the GM may choose), they will be pulled into the water and thus be in danger of drowning.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to account for the weight of armor worn! If a giant octopus fails a morale check, it will squirt out a cloud of black “ink” 40’ in diameter and then jet away at twice normal speed for 2d6 rounds. Any characters being held will normally be released at this point.</p>

<p>Ogres appear as large, very ugly humans. Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing consists of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally repellent odor. Ogres are brutish and aggressive, but inherently lazy. They employ direct attacks in combat, typically using large clubs, axes, or pole arms, generally causing 2d6 damage. If normal weapons are employed, an ogre has a +3 bonus to damage due to strength. If an ogre fights bare-handed, it does 1d8 subduing damage per hit.</p>
<p>One out of every six ogres will be a pack leader of 6+1 Hit Dice (500 XP). Ogres gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a pack leader. In ogre lairs of 10 or greater, there will also be an ogre bully of 8+2 Hit Dice (875 XP), with an Armor Class of 17 (13) (movement 20’) and having a +4 bonus to damage due to strength. Ogre bullies generally wire together pieces of chainmail to wear over their hides. Ogres gain +2 to morale so long as the ogre bully is present (and alive).</p>

<p>Orcs are grotesque humanoids bent on war and domination. They have lupine ears, reddish eyes, truncated, upturned noses, and black hair (but very little body hair). An adult male orc is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds; females are slightly smaller. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. They utilize all manner of weapons and armor scavenged from battlefields.</p>
<p>Orcs have Darkvision to a range of 60’. They suffer a -1 attack penalty in bright sunlight or within the radius of a spell causing magical light. They speak their own rough and simple language, but many also speak some common or goblin.</p>
<p>One out of every eight orcs will be a warrior of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP). Orcs gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In orc lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11), a movement 20’, and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or more, there will be an orc king of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with an Armor Class of 16 (11), in chainmail with a shield, movement 20’, and having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, orcs never fail a morale check as long as the orc king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present. A shaman is equivalent to a warrior orc statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.</p>

<p>Owls are birds of prey with large eyes and the ability to fly without making a sound. They are nocturnal, and have superior Darkvision of 120’ range. An owl will stand about 6 to 18 inches tall with a wingspan of 20 inches. An owl’s vision is very sharp and comparable to that of a falcon. It can also hear very well, even to the point that a rodent creeping through grass will draw attention. The owl will fly over a field and listen and watch for movement and then dive for a kill with its talons.</p>

<p>Owlbear are among the most feared of the nocturnal forest dwelling monsters, and for good reason for they are always hungry and always aggressive. They appear to be bears with owlish faces, including a large, sharp beak. They fight much as do bears, and as with normal bears an owlbear must hit with both claws in order to do the listed “hug” damage.</p>
<p>These monsters are known to hunt by day when particularly hungry, but they prefer to live nocturnally. They have superior Darkvision with a range of 120 feet, without the usual penalties for being in full sunlight. They are also very quiet, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 in their native territory.</p>

<p>Pixies are winged fairies often found in forested areas. Like sprites, pixies love beauty. They dress in bright colors and favor clothing with flourishes like feathered caps, curly-tipped shoes, scarves, and so on. They are quite small, just 2½ feet in height and weighing no more than 30 pounds. Pixies can only fly for 3 turns maximum before requiring rest of at least one turn, during which time the pixie may walk at normal speed but may not fly.</p>
<p>A pixie can become <strong>invisible</strong> at will, as many times per day as it wishes, and can attack while remaining invisible. Anyone attacking an invisible pixie does so with an attack penalty of -4 unless the attacker can somehow detect invisible creatures. Pixies may ambush their foes while invisible; if they do so, they surprise on 1-5 on 1d6.</p>
<p>Pixies are whimsical, enjoying nothing so much as a good joke or prank, especially at the expense of a “big person.”</p>

<p>Purple worms are gigantic subterranean monsters; they are rarely found above ground. The body of a mature purple worm is 5-8 feet in diameter and 60-100 feet long, weighing about 40,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail; those injured by it must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die. Note that the purple worm’s movement is less than the monster’s length, so that, if attacking from out of a tunnel, it might not be able to use the stinger for several rounds.</p>
<p>Any time a purple worm successfully bites a man-sized or smaller opponent with a natural roll of 19 or 20, the opponent has been swallowed, and will suffer 3d6 damage per round afterward due to being digested. A character who has been swallowed can only effectively attack with small cutting or stabbing weapons such as dagger or shortsword.</p>

<p>These omnivorous rodents thrive almost anywhere. Normal rats attack as a swarm; each point of damage done to the swarm reduces their numbers by one animal.</p>
<p>Giant rats are scavengers, but will attack to defend their nests and territories. A giant rat can grow to be up to 4 feet long and weigh over 50 pounds. A single giant rat, or a small group of up to four, will generally be shy, but larger packs attack fearlessly, biting and chewing with their sharp incisors.</p>
<p>Any rat bite has a 5% chance of causing a disease. A character who suffers one or more rat bites where the die roll indicates disease will sicken in 3d6 hours. The infected character will lose one point of Constitution per hour; after losing each point, the character is allowed a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray (adjusted by the current Constitution bonus or penalty) to break the fever and end the disease. Any character reduced to zero Constitution is dead. See&nbsp;<strong>Constitution Point Losses</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>Encounter</strong>&nbsp;section for details on regaining lost Constitution.</p>
<p>* Note: The XP award for normal rats is for driving away or killing an entire pack of normal size. If the adventurers are forced to flee, the GM should award 3 XP per rat slain.</p>

<p>The rhagodessa is related to both spiders and scorpions, though it is not properly either. Rhagodessas have “pedipalps,” an elongated pair of forelegs with sticky pads on them for capturing prey.</p>
<p>Giant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found in desert terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while those found underground may be black or white in color (those found in the deepest caverns are always white). Like spiders, they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise climb entirely upside down.</p>
<p>A hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast and will be drawn to the rhagodessa’s mouth on the next round and automatically hit for 2d8 points of damage; this repeats each round, so long as the victim is held. Escaping from the sticky hold requires a successful roll to open doors. If both legs hit, this roll frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa can simply attack again with the free leg on the next round. Alternately, victims may attack with small or medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2 is added to the attack roll if a small weapon is used. If the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in this case another character can help, making the roll for the victim).</p>
<p>The rhagodessa seems unable to use its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way, and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim will attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace.</p>

<p>Rocs are birds similar to eagles, but even a “normal” roc is huge, being about 9 feet long and having a wingspan of 24 feet. Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. Like most birds, the males have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be hidden, that is).</p>
<p>A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1,200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3,000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to 6,000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off full- grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds.</p>
<p>A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to be as “fresh” as possible when given to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary).</p>
<p>When rocs are encountered they are almost certainly hunting, and will generally attack creatures of horse size or less. If facing a large group the rocs may make passes close overhead to scatter them first before each chooses a single target to prey upon. Mated pairs found in their nests will fight to the death to protect their eggs or offspring (morale of 12 in this case).</p>

<p>Rot grubs are 1-inch long vermin found in carrion, dung, and other such garbage and organic material. Their skin color is white or brown. When a living creature contacts an area (dung heap, offal, etc) infested with rot grubs, the grubs will attack if they can come in contact the victim’s skin. A rot grub secretes an anesthetic when it bites and will burrow into the flesh. A burrowing grub can be noticed if the victim succeeds at a Wisdom check. If successful, the victim sees strange rippling beneath his skin. If failed, the creature does not notice the grubs. During the first two rounds, a burrowing rot grub can be killed by applying fire to the infested skin or by cutting open the infested skin with any slashing weapon. Either method deals 2d6 points of damage to the victim, but kills the grubs. After the second round, only a cure disease can kill the grubs as they burrow to the victim’s heart and devour it in 1d3 turns.</p>

<p>A rust monster (sometimes known as a corroder or corrosion beast) is a strange monster built like a huge turtle, with an insectoid head sporting large feather-like antennae and a thick tail with a hammer-like protrusion at the tip which seems to serve no purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>The touch of any part of a rust monster’s body oxidizes metal objects instantly, turning them to rust, verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate. One attacks with its antennae, brushing them over metal items. Non- magical metal attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A hit with a non-magical metal weapon inflicts half damage before the weapon is destroyed. Magic weapons or armor permanently lose one “plus” each time they make contact with the monster.</p>
<p>The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this. Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to a rust monster and will be ignored. While rust monsters will consume oxides of silver or copper, they have a strong preference for ferrous metals (iron or steel), preferring them over any other metal.</p>
<p>Whether the rust monster is in any way related to the rarer ironbane (as found on page 115) is unknown, but both monsters seem to have the exact same power.</p>

<p>The sabre-tooth cat, or smilodon, is a prehistoric great cat with very large canine teeth. They are more robustly built than other great cats, with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canine teeth. Sabre-tooth cats are ambush predators, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 in their natural environment (forests and tall-grass prairies), where they prey primarily upon large herbivores.</p>

<p>Flame salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Fire. They look like giant snakes, more than 12’ long, with dragon-like heads and lizard forelimbs. Their scales are all the colors of flame, red and orange and yellow. A flame salamander is flaming hot, and all non- fire-resistant creatures within 20’ of the monster suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the heat. They are immune to damage from any fire or heat attack. Flame salamanders are intelligent; they speak the language of the Plane of Fire, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or Dragon.</p>

<p>Frost salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Water. They look like giant lizards with six legs. Their scales are the colors of ice, white, pale gray and pale blue. Frost salamanders are very cold, and all non- cold-resistant creatures within 20’ suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the cold. Frost salamanders are completely immune to all types of cold-based attacks. They are quite intelligent; all speak the language of the Plane of Water, and many also speak Common, Elvish, and/or Dragon.</p>
<p>Flame and frost salamanders hate each other, and each type will attack the other on sight, in preference over any other foe. If summoned by a Magic-User, a salamander is often assigned to protect a location, doorway, or treasure hoard; in such a case, the salamander will attack anyone attempting to gain unauthorized access to the protected area. Those which arrive through natural rifts may have any goals or motivations the GM wishes, and thus may choose to parley, fight, or even ignore adventurers.</p>

<p>Lightning Salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Air. A lightning salamander resembles a giant snake more than 12 feet long with two dragon-like heads (on short but flexible necks). Its scales are all the colors of lightning: white, blue, purple, and yellow. A lightning salamander constantly emits little bolts of lightning; all creatures within 20 feet of the salamander that are not lightning-resistant suffer 1d8 points of damage per round. A lightning salamander is immune to damage from any type of electrical or lightning attack. It is intelligent and can speak the language of the Plane of Air, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or Dragon.</p>
<p>Despite having two heads a lightning salamander has only one mind; either head may speak or both may, but it is very rare to meet a lightning salamander who can speak different words with each head at the same time (although those who can are known to sing duets with themselves, which may give away one’s location to those listening).</p>

<p>Sand salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Earth. A sand salamander resembles a giant sea turtle with six flippers and a serpentine neck and head, with scales of varying shades of gray or brown.</p>
<p>The sand salamander’s most feared attack is its bite, for any living creature bitten by one must save vs.&nbsp;Petrify or be turned to stone. In addition to attacking, a sand salamander can temporarily transform any stone within a 20 foot radius into sand. Characters in the affected area must save vs.&nbsp;Paralysis each round in order to move through the sand, and if the save is successful, the character is still reduced to half their normal movement. Whenever the sand salamander moves out of range, the sand “congeals” back into stone, and any character in the affected area must save vs.&nbsp;Paralysis or become trapped. Extraction of a trapped person may take quite a long time, chipping and hammering at the stone to break it apart.</p>
<p>A sand salamander is immune to piercing attacks (such as spears or arrows) and suffers half damage from cutting attacks. It is intelligent and can speak the language of the Plane of Earth; many may also know Elvish, Common, or Dragon.</p>

<p>Giant scorpions are quite large, sometimes as large as a donkey. They are aggressive predators and generally attack on sight. If a claw attack hits, the giant scorpion receives a +2 attack bonus with its stinger (but two claw hits do not give a double bonus). Those hit by the stinger must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die. Giant scorpions are most commonly found in desert areas or caverns.</p>

<p>A shadow can be difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas but stands out starkly in brightly illuminated places. They lurk in dark places, waiting for living prey to happen by. A shadow is 5 to 6 feet tall and is weightless. Shadows cannot speak intelligibly. Despite their strange nature and appearance, shadows are not&nbsp;<strong>undead</strong>monsters, and thus cannot be Turned by a Cleric.</p>
<p>A shadow’s attack does 1d4 damage (from cold) and drains 1 point of Strength from the victim. Victims reduced to 2 or fewer points of Strength collapse and become unable to move; those reduced to 0 Strength die and rise as shadows a day later (at nightfall). Otherwise, Strength points lost to shadows are recovered at a rate of 1 point per turn.</p>
<p>Due to their incorporeal nature, shadows cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.</p>

<p>Giant shrews resemble giant rats, but are larger, being up to 6’ long, and darker in color. They have a very fast metabolic rate and must eat almost constantly. Giant shrews are omnivorous, and aggressively defend their nests and the immediate territory around them.</p>
<p>Giant shrews move so swiftly that they are able to bite twice per round, and they may attack two different adjacent opponents in this way.</p>
<p>A few giant shrew species (generally no more than 5% of those encountered) are venomous. The bite of such a giant shrew will kill the victim unless a save vs.&nbsp;Poison is made. A victim bitten twice in a round need only save once for that round, but of course will have to save again in subsequent rounds if bitten again.</p>

<p>A shrieker, sometimes called a wailing morel, is a large (3’ to 5’ tall and about the same size across), semi- mobile fungus that wails loudly as a defense mechanism when approached or threatened. Shriekers are found in underground areas such as caverns and dungeons. They are found in a variety of pale colors, most commonly white, gray, lavender, or red.</p>
<p>This monster does not attack directly; rather, its shrieking tends to attract the attention of other monsters in the nearby area. Movement or light within 10 feet, or causing any damage to one, will cause one to wail for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p>In game terms, the GM should generally roll a wandering monster check each round that this monster wails.</p>

<p>Pit vipers are highly venomous snakes. There are many varieties ranging in size from 2’ to 12’ at adulthood; the statistics above are for an “average” variety which reaches about 9’ in length.</p>
<p>Those bitten by a pit viper must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die.</p>
<p>Pit vipers are named for the thermally sensitive “pits” between their eyes and nostrils. These are used to detect birds, mammals, and lizards, the natural prey of these snakes. Note that, even though lizards are cold-blooded, pit vipers can still sense them because their temperature will often be slightly higher or lower than their surroundings.</p>
<p>Rattlesnakes are a variety of pit viper; in addition to the details given above, a rattlesnake has a rattle (from which it gets its name) at the end of its tail. The rattle is used to warn away larger creatures.</p>

<p>After a successful bite attack, a python will wrap itself around the victim (in the same round), constricting for 2d4 damage plus an additional 2d4 per round thereafter. The hold may be broken on a roll of 1 on 1d6 (add the victim’s Strength bonus to the range, so a Strength of 16 would result in a range of 1-3 on 1d6); breaking the hold takes a full round.</p>

<p>Sea snakes are relatively small; the largest varieties rarely exceed 6’ in length. They have relatively small heads, and are very stealthy in the water. Their bite does so little damage that the creature bitten has only a 50% chance to notice the attack, but their poison is terribly strong, such that any creature bitten must save vs.&nbsp;Poison at a penalty of -4 or die.</p>
<p>Fortunately, sea snakes rarely attack; only if molested (grabbed, stepped on, etc.) will they do so. They are very clumsy when out of the water.</p>

<p>Spitting cobras average about 7’ in length at adulthood. They use their spreading hood to warn other creatures not to bother them, and generally refrain from attacking if possible to allow larger creatures time to retreat. Failure to retreat from the spitting cobra will likely result in the cobra spitting venom; the cobra can project its venom up to 5’, and any creature hit must roll a save vs.&nbsp;Poison or be blinded permanently (though the&nbsp;<strong>cure blindness</strong>&nbsp;spell can be used to heal this injury). If the cobra cannot deter a creature by spitting, it will attack using its bite. In this case, those successfully hit must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die.</p>

<p>Spectres are incorporeal undead monsters. On any successful hit against a living creature, a spectre drains two life energy levels in addition to doing normal damage. Any character slain by a spectre will arise at the next sunset (but not sooner than 6 hours after death) as a spectre under the control of its killer.</p>
<p>A spectre will normally resemble the living creature it used to be. Most spectres are formed from humanoid creatures, but some may have other forms and sizes; statistically, most such creatures will be as given above, but of course the GM may create special types.</p>
<p>Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to&nbsp;<strong>sleep</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>charm</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>hold</strong>&nbsp;magics. Due to their incorporeal nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.</p>

<p>The giant black widow spider is a much enlarged version of the ordinary black widow; a full-grown male has a leg-span of 2 feet, while an adult female will be 3’ or more across. Despite the size difference, both genders are statistically equal. Both genders are marked with an orange “hourglass” on the abdomen.</p>
<p>The venom of the giant black widow is strong, such that those bitten must save vs.&nbsp;Poison at a penalty of -2 or die. Giant black widow spiders spin strong, sticky, nearly invisible webs, usually across passageways or cave entrances, or sometimes between trees in the wilderness; those who stumble into these webs become stuck, and must roll to escape just as if opening a door. Any character stuck in such a web cannot effectively cast spells or use a weapon.</p>

<p>Crab spiders are ambush predators, hiding using various forms of camouflage and leaping out to bite their surprised prey. Giant crab spiders are horribly enlarged, being around 3’ in length. They can change color slowly (over the course of a few days), taking on the overall coloration of their preferred lair or ambush location. After this change is complete, the spider is able to surprise potential prey on 1-4 on 1d6 when in that preferred location. Anyone bitten by a giant crab spider must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die.</p>

<p>Giant tarantulas are huge, hairy spiders, about the size of a pony. They run down their prey much as wolves do. The bite of the giant tarantula is poisonous; those bitten must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or be forced to dance wildly. The dance lasts 2d10 rounds, during which time the victim has a -4 penalty on attack and saving throw rolls. If the victim is a Thief, he or she cannot use any Thief abilities while dancing. Onlookers must save vs.&nbsp;Spells or begin dancing themselves; such “secondary” victims suffer the same penalties as above, but they will only dance for 2d4 rounds.</p>
<p>Each round the original victim dances, he or she must save vs.&nbsp;Poison again or take 1d4 points of damage. Secondary victims do not suffer this effect.</p>
<p><strong>Neutralize poison</strong>&nbsp;will cure the original victim, and&nbsp;<strong>dispel magic</strong>&nbsp;will stop the dance for all victims in the area of effect, whether they are original or secondary.</p>

<p>The giant squid dwells in the deep ocean. One can grow to a tremendous size, to a maximum of around 40 feet for females and 33 feet for males. The mantle of the giant squid is about 6½ feet long (more for females, less for males). Their tentacles are studded with barbs and sharp-edged suckers.</p>
<p>Members of any group of these creatures encountered are equally likely to be male or female. The GM may roll for this or may assign them as they see fit.</p>
<p>In order to bite a creature, the giant squid must hit with at least two tentacles first. Further, any time a giant squid hits with at least one tentacle per each 75 pounds of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it; unless the victim can find a way to resist (using whatever method the player might think of and whatever rolls the GM may choose), they will be pulled into the water and thus be in danger of drowning. Don’t forget to account for the weight of armor worn!</p>
<p>If a giant squid fails a morale check, it will squirt out a cloud of black “ink” 30’ in diameter and then jet away at twice normal speed for 3d8 rounds. If a group fails a morale check they will move away in random directions in hopes that at least one will escape any pursuit.</p>

<p>Stirges are weird winged creatures that some say may have invaded from some other plane of existence. They are relatively small, just about 1 foot long with a wingspan of about 2 feet and an average weight of 1 pound. They vaguely resemble hairless bats with a rubbery tubular proboscis and no back legs (so that their body simply comes to a blunt point at the rear).</p>
<p>If a stirge hits a living creature, it grabs on with hooked claws on its wing joints and quickly embeds its proboscis in the victim’s body. The proboscis has rows of tiny serrated teeth on the inside, and literally turns itself inside out as it carves a way into the victim’s body. This causes 1d4 points of damage, and the stirge then proceeds to suck the victim’s blood, inflicting an additional 1d4 points of damage each round.</p>
<p>Once attached, the creature can only be removed by killing it. The victim cannot use weapons larger than a dagger or hand axe to attack the creature, and cannot attack it at all if attacked from behind. Others may attack the creature with a bonus of +2 on the die roll, but any attack that misses hits the victim instead.</p>

<p>A strangle vine (sometimes called an assassin vine) is a strange animated plant found in temperate and tropical forests, particularly in areas with poor-quality soil. They fertilize their soil by entangling, constricting, and killing living creatures, then depositing the bodies in loose soil around the plant’s base.</p>
<p>Because it can lie very still indeed, a strangle vine surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs.&nbsp;Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.</p>
<p>Strangle vines are actually mobile, able to uproot themselves and move slowly from place to place; one generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.</p>
<p>Each plant consists of a single long vine of up to 20 feet in length, with many smaller vines 5 feet or so in length packed closely, two vines per foot or thereabouts. The smaller vines are covered in leaves, and in the fall they bear clusters of reddish-purple berries which are tough and bitter but not poisonous.</p>
<p>There is a similar plant found in underground environments which has leaves the color of iron with pale shiny metallic veins. They grow near geothermal vents or springs, and the rotting flesh that surrounds them often supports mushrooms of various sizes and types. This fungal growth conceals the strangle vine, allowing it to surprise on 1-5 on 1d6 as does the above- ground variety of the plant.</p>

<p>Tentacle worms appear to be giant worms of some sort, averaging 6 to 8 feet long. Their heads are pasty white or grey, but their bodies vary from livid pink or purple to deep green in color. Their tentacles splay out from around the creature’s “neck.” Some sages believe they are the larval form of some other monster, but this has never been proven.</p>
<p>A tentacle worm can attack as many as three adjacent opponents. Those hit must save vs.&nbsp;Paralysis or be paralyzed 2d4 turns. No matter how many of a tentacle worm’s attacks hit an opponent in a given round, only one saving throw is required in each such round.</p>
<p>If all opponents of a tentacle worm are rendered paralyzed, it will begin to feed upon the paralyzed victims, doing 1 point of damage every 1d8 rounds until the victim is dead; if other paralyzed victims are still alive, the worm is 50% likely to move on immediately to another still-living victim. Otherwise, it continues to eat the corpse of the slain victim for 1d4 turns.</p>

Females are smaller, averaging about 8 feet long and an average of about 275 pounds. Tigers are most recognizable for their dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.</p>
<p>Tigers are apex predators and prefer prey such as deer and wild boar. They are territorial and generally solitary but social predators, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support their requirements for prey.</p>

<p>A titanothere is a huge prehistoric animal that resembles the rhinoceros; adults average 10’ tall and 13’ long. They have large, forked horns rather than the pointed horns of rhinos. Like rhinos, they are herd animals, and males aggressively defend the herd; females only enter combat if the male(s) are defeated or the attackers are very numerous. If a single titanothere is encountered, it will be a rogue male; they are bad tempered and prone to attacking smaller creatures that enter their territory.</p>

<p>Treants are a race of large, roughly humanoid tree- people. When one stands still with its legs together it cannot be easily distinguished from a normal oak tree. Their leaves are nearly identical to oak leaves, and are green in spring and summer, turning orange, red, or yellow in the fall and winter. A treant’s leaves do not normally fall out in the winter, but as some oaks also retain their leaves into cold weather this may not help in identifying one.</p>
<p>Being actual trees, treants are big, averaging 25 to 35 feet in height and weighing 4,000 to 5,000 pounds. Their language is difficult for most other races to learn, though Elves are known to have an advantage in mastering it. Many treants know Elvish, and some who live near humans learn Common as well.</p>
<p>Treants are slow to act when potential enemies are nearby, preferring watch them carefully before taking any action. Because of their excellent camouflage treants gain surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.</p>
<p>All treants have the power to animate other normal trees in their area; up to two trees can be animated at once, but the treant can release one and animate another if needed. Trees to be animated must be within 180 feet of the treant, and must remain within that range or they will return to their normal state. An animated tree requires a full round to uproot itself before it can move around, and then can move at a rate of just 10’ per round. Of course, if enemies are within reach the animated tree need not be uprooted. If the treant controlling an animated tree is slain or incapacitated, the tree returns to its normal state.</p>
<p>Any character or creature nearby when this happens must save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray to scamper away; those who fail will suffer 2d6 points of damage and will be trapped under the fallen tree. The GM should consider battlefield conditions when deciding on the exact results of such an event.</p>

<p>Trolls are huge, rangy humanoids with lumpy skin that is a dull grayish green in color. They stand up to 9 feet tall despite having a rather hunched posture, and may weigh as much as 600 pounds. Their skin is rubbery and slightly damp to the touch, and they have long sharp black claws and long sharp white teeth. Trolls have a disconcerting tendency to smile toothily most of the time, as if their brutal lives are the most entertaining thing imaginable.</p>
<p>Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of damage each round after being injured. A troll reduced to 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point. Note that the troll may “play dead” until it has regenerated further. Damage from fire and acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces attackers armed with fire or acid.</p>
<p>The regenerative power of trolls is so great that limbs or other body parts (even a head!) can be reattached if severed simply by pressing the severed ends back together for a moment. Trolls in a group will generally help dismembered fellows to reassemble themselves, but only if it’s convenient. If the severed part is not restored, a new one will grow in its place in 1d4 turns.</p>
<p>Note that a troll with a new head will not remember its former life, nor will it yet know how to speak; it will behave as would any confused and hostile animal.</p>
<p>Trolls speak a primitive language, and are often fluent in Goblin, Hobgoblin, Orc, Ogre, or Giant depending on which of these species live nearest them. A few (20% or so) speak Common.</p>
<p>Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed. Though trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and claws.</p>
<p>A trollwife is a female troll; despite the name, there is no requirement that she be married (nor, in fact, do trolls normally engage in formal marriages). A typical adult trollwife stands 11 feet tall and weighs 700 pounds. They have no outward appearance of femininity, at least according to the standards of humans, elves, or even orcs; rather, a trollwife simply looks like an extraordinarily large troll. Like a normal male troll, a trollwife has lumpy skin that is a dull grayish green in color.</p>
<p>Trollwives have all the abilities and weaknesses of the males of the species; in particular, they regenerate exactly as do the males.</p>
<p>When encountered, a trollwife may be alone, cohabitating with a male (her “husband”), or raising a brood of trollkin. Roll 1d10; on a result of 1, she is living alone; on a roll of 2-3, she is raising her young; on 4 or higher, she is living with a male. If one has a mate or offspring, there is a 1-3 on 1d10 chance she is encountered alone, 4-7 that her mate or young are encountered in her absence, or 8-10 that all are present.</p>
<p>Add 1 to the trollwife’s morale score if she is with her mate, or 2 if she has young present. This means that, unless threatened with fire or acid, a trollwife will fight without checking morale while her offspring are present. If a trollwife’s mate or offspring are slain in her absence, she will track the killers unerringly, and upon finding them will attack with the same morale bonus.</p>
<p>Trollwives are solitary with respect to other adult trollwives, for they hate each other with a fierce passion. If forced together they will put aside their enmity until all non-troll enemies are dead (at which point they may well fight over who will eat the choicest of the remains).</p>

<p>Trollkin are young trolls. They have all the powers and weaknesses of trolls, and look exactly like smaller than normal adult trolls. Even an infant has the same ability to regenerate as an adult troll.</p>
<p>When you encounter trollkin, you can rest assured that there is a trollwife nearby (unless, of course, you’ve already slain her). They are as bloodthirsty as their parents; as such, determining the number appearing is done in a particularly unusual fashion:</p>
<p>Roll 1d6 for the number of individuals, and 2d6 for the number of hit dice. Divide the number of hit dice by the number of individuals to arrive at the hit dice of each individual. Note that a trollkin won’t be encountered having more than 6 hit dice, so if only one individual is indicated by the 1d6 roll but the 2d6 roll totals more than 6, you must increase the number of individuals. The referee should feel free to round the number of hit dice up or down as they see fit, or to allocate them in an approximately equal fashion if desired. Trollkin broods are rolled in this way owing to the fact that bigger or tougher individuals are likely to kill and eat the weaker ones, generally when their mother is out hunting.</p>
<p>Refer to the entry for trolls for details regarding regeneration, morale checks, and so on; except as noted above, trollkins share all these features with the adults</p>

<p>Turtles and tortoises are reptiles with a hard shell into which the animal can pull its head and legs if threatened. Turtles will be found in marshes and near rivers or ponds, while tortoises are terrestrial and typically found in arid regions. (The specific names given to these animals are often misleading, as a tortoise might be called a turtle and vice versa.) The statistics given above are representative, and can be used for other species as needed. These animals are well-camouflaged, gaining surprise on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6 in their natural habitat.</p>

<p>Unicorns are horselike creatures having a single spirally-twisted horn in the middle of the forehead. A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.</p>
<p>Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.</p>
<p>Three times per day a unicorn can cast&nbsp;<strong>cure light wounds</strong>&nbsp;by a touch of its horn. Once per day a unicorn can transport itself 360’ (as the spell&nbsp;<strong>dimension door</strong>), and can carry a full load (possibly including a rider) while doing so. A light load for a unicorn is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.</p>
<p>An Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid stronger parties.</p>
<p>Alicorns cannot heal or transport themselves by magic as unicorns do. However, alicorns may become invisible at will, exactly as if wearing a&nbsp;<strong>ring of invisibility</strong>.</p>

<p>These creatures appear to be normal&nbsp;<strong>hobgoblins</strong>, but urgoblins are actually a mutant subspecies. Urgoblins are able to regenerate much as do&nbsp;<strong>trolls</strong>&nbsp;(with the same limitations). All urgoblins are male; if an urgoblin mates with a female hobgoblin, any offspring will also be male, but only one in four such offspring will share their father’s gifts. Like hobgoblins, urgoblins wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields into battle, blending in perfectly.</p>
<p>Some hobgoblin tribes consider urgoblins an abomination, and kill them whenever they can be identified. Other hobgoblin tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord them great honor. There are even rumors of a tribe entirely made up of urgoblins, with kidnapped hobgoblin females as their mates; reportedly they slit the throats of all infants born to their mates, so that only those who have the power of regeneration survive.</p>

<p>Vampires are <strong>undead</strong> monsters. Though they may look just a bit more pale than when they were alive, they do appear to live and even breathe as mortals do. A vampire has all the memories and abilities it had in life, and is effectively immortal. Living forever in the shadows often leads to vampires being decadent, while their hunger for blood makes them cruel.</p>
<p>Vampires cast no reflections in silvered mirrors or water, though despite conventional wisdom to the contrary they do reflect in shiny base metals; the innate purity of silver and water simply will not reflect them. A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs.&nbsp;Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by the vampire.</p>
<p>The bite inflicts 1d3 points of damage, then each round thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates (i.e.&nbsp;is healed) for up to 1d6 hit points for each energy level drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, they will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later) and thereafter will be under the complete control of the “parent” vampire (but is freed if that vampire is ever destroyed).</p>
<p>If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and thus a vampire will generally choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite.</p>
<p>Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are immune to <strong>sleep, charm, and hold</strong> spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.</p>
<p>Creatures of the night obey vampires. Once per day a vampire can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby). The creatures summoned arrive 2d6 rounds later and will obey the vampire for up to an hour before leaving.</p>
<p>Vampires can also transform into the form of these creatures, assuming the shape of a giant bat (page 66), giant rat (page 135), or a dire wolf (page 158) at will. The transformation requires a single round during which the vampire cannot attack. The flying movement given above is for the giant bat form; the vampire can use the attack forms of the animal shape assumed, as given on the indicated pages. The vampire cannot activate any of its other powers while in animal form, but effects already active will remain so.</p>
<p>Vampires are powerful indeed, but they do have several specific weaknesses.</p>
<p>First, a vampire can be held at bay by several things, including the smell of garlic, a silver or silvered mirror, or a holy symbol presented by a believer (GM’s discretion is advised here, but in general someone threatened by a vampire may be more devout than usual). In such a situation the vampire cannot approach within 5 feet of the repellent item or character, nor can it make any melee attacks or otherwise touch those within the warded area.</p>
<p><strong>Running water</strong> (such as a stream or river) acts as a barrier to a vampire; one cannot cross over any such waterway, neither by bridge or by waterway or even by flying. It is possible for a vampire to be carried across while lying in its own coffin with the lid closed; the presence of the water flowing beneath the coffin will force the vampire to remain dormant.</p>
<p>Finally, a vampire may not enter any private dwelling without being invited by someone who resides there, and then only if invited while the resident is actually inside the structure. Public buildings of any sort do not present this problem; even inns are fully accessible to a vampire.</p>
<p><strong>Destroying a vampire</strong> is not an easy task. When reduced to zero hit points or less a vampire becomes incapacitated but is not slain (as previously explained). <strong>If exposed to direct sunlight</strong>, the vampire will be utterly destroyed in a single round if it cannot find a way to escape in that time. <strong>Being immersed in running water</strong> (as defined above) causes 3d8 points of damage each round, and if reduced to zero or fewer hit points in this way the vampire is destroyed. If the vampire is <strong>cremated in a funeral pyre</strong> while in any dormant state it will be destroyed.</p>
<p>The most dramatic method of defeating a vampire is actually the least reliable: <strong>driving a wooden stake through its heart</strong>. Doing this will instantly reduce the vampire to zero hit points, and it will remain “dead” for so long as the stake is present. Removal of the stake, however, allows the vampire to begin regenerating as described above. It is not normally possible to drive a stake through a vampire’s heart while it is actively resisting, but this can be done after reducing the monster to zero hit points in the usual way. Of course, after staking a vampire it is possible to use sunlight, running water, or a funeral pyre as described above to complete its destruction.</p>

<p>Giant water termites vary from 1’ to 5’ in length. They attack using a noxious spray with a range of 5’ which stuns the target for a full turn on a hit; a save vs.&nbsp;Poison is allowed to avoid the effect. A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the remainder of the current round and all of the next one.</p>
<p>However, the primary concern regarding these monsters is the damage they can do to boats and ships. Each creature can do 2d4 points of damage to a ship’s hull per round (no roll required) for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus the creature’s hit dice total; after this time, the monster is full. They eat noisily.</p>
<p>These creatures are found in fresh and salt water as well as in swamps. The freshwater variety tend to be smaller, 1-2 hit dice, the saltwater variety 3-4 hit dice, and those found in swamps range from 2-3 hit dice.</p>

<p>Giant weasels resemble their more normally sized cousins, having long bodies, short legs, and pointed, toothy snouts. They are predatory animals, hunting those creatures smaller than themselves.</p>
<p>Weasels of all sorts are cunning, crafty hunters, and surprise their prey on 1-3 on 1d6. Once a giant weasel bites a living creature, it hangs on, rending with its teeth each round until the victim or the weasel is dead, or until the weasel fails a morale check (rolled normally) in which case it will let go of its victim and flee.</p>
<p>There are many varieties of normal-sized weasel, including several which are called ferrets; in some territories, the giant weasel is thus called a giant ferret. The only distinction is that those which are tamed are always called ferrets, though not all giant ferrets are tame. Various humanoid races as well as some fairy creatures are known to tame giant ferrets for use as guards or war-animals.</p>

<p>These ferocious creatures are about 30 feet long. Killer whales, also called “orca” (both singular and plural), are strikingly marked in black and white, with prominent white patches that resemble eyes. Their real eyes are much smaller and located away from the fake eye-spots.</p>
<p>Killer whales eat fish, squid, seals, and other whales, but are not above consuming a meal of human or demi-human fare.</p>

<p>Narwhals are aquatic mammals resembling large dolphins with a single (or rarely, double) tusk protruding straight forward from the mouth. The tusk is helical in shape, and they are sometimes cut short and sold as “unicorn horns.” However, they have no particular magical value. Narwhals are found in cold northern seas. They are not particularly aggressive.</p>

<p>These creatures can be up to 60 feet long. They prey on giant squid. Sperm whales can emit an invisible focused beam of sound 5’ wide up to a 50’ range underwater. This blast of sound disorients target creatures, leaving them effectively stunned for 1d4 rounds. A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the indicated duration. No attack roll is required, but a save vs.&nbsp;Death Ray is allowed to resist. A sperm whale can emit as many such blasts of sound as it desires, once per round, instead of biting.</p>

<p>A wight’s appearance is a weird and twisted reflection of the form it had in life. A wight is about the height and weight of a human. Wights do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.</p>
<p>If a wight touches (or is touched by) a living creature, that living creature suffers one level of&nbsp;<strong>energy drain</strong>&nbsp;(as described in the&nbsp;<strong>Encounter</strong>&nbsp;section). No saving throw is allowed. Striking a wight with a weapon does not count as “touching” it.</p>
<p>Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight by the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later). Wight spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death.</p>
<p>Like all undead, wights may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to&nbsp;<strong>sleep</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>charm</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>hold</strong>&nbsp;magics. Wights are harmed only by silver or magical weapons, and take only half damage from burning oil.</p>

<p>A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail. A wyvern’s body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton. They are built more like bats than lizards, having two legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have four legs and two wings.</p>
<p>Wyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.</p>
<p>Wyverns attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, clawing at its opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. Any living creature hit by the wyvern’s stinger must save vs.&nbsp;Poison or die. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack or when landing.</p>
<p>If a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry off its victim; only victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most 6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it may be dropped.</p>

<p>A Zombraire is a free-willed undead Magic-User. Like the zombie it resembles, a zombraire moves silently, is very strong, and must be literally hacked to pieces to be destroyed. However, it does not suffer the initiative penalty common to ordinary zombies. It takes only half damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical bonus). It may be Turned by a Cleric (as a wight), and is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells.</p>
<p>A zombraire slowly rots away, and as it does it loses its sanity; this is represented by the variable morale listed. An insane zombraire fights to the death in hopes of being slain, thus ending its tortured existence.</p>
<p>The given statistics are for a zombraire formed from a 2nd-level Magic-user; the HD and saving throws of a zombraire are based on the level it had in life. A zombraire can cast spells as it did when living, but cannot learn new spells.</p>
<p>A Skeletaire is the final form of a zombraire which has rotted away completely. It takes only half damage from edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical bonus). It can be Turned by a Cleric (as a zombie), and is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. A skeletaire never fails morale, and thus always fights until destroyed.</p>
<p>The statistics above are for a skeletaire formed from a 2nd-level Magic-user. A skeletaire will have HD equal to the character’s level minus 1, and will save as a Magic-user of the level equal to its HD. The skeletaire cannot speak, but still retains the ability to prepare and cast spells as it did in life (but like a zombraire, it cannot learn new spells).</p>
<p>The process of creating or becoming a zombraire are variable, and often involve cursed magic items (especially cursed scrolls).</p>
