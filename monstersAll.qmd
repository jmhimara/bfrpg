Giant ants are fantastically enlarged versions of the more common variety of ants. Normal workers are 5 to 6 feet long; queens are larger, growing up to 9 feet in length. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair.

Giant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets.

Large and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length. Though smaller, their colonies have more members, and so their lair treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of giant ants.

## Antelope

The statistics above represent common sorts of wild herd animals, including deer (1 hit die), aurochs (2 hit dice), elk or moose (3 hit dice) and bison (4 hit dice). Such creatures are often skittish and likely to flee if provoked, but males are more aggressive in the presence of females (the parenthesized morale applies in this case).

Cattle, aurochs, and bison are not included in this category, they have their own [entry](#cattle-including-aurochs-and-bison). 

Generally, 1 hit die herd animals inflict 1d4 points of
damage on a hit, 2 and 3 hit die animals inflict 1d6, and
4 hit die animals inflict 1d8. The GM should feel free to
vary from these figures as he or she sees fit; there are
many types of herd animals in the world, and some are
better armed than others.

Carnivorous apes appear much like ordinary gorillas, but are bad-tempered and aggressive. They are actually omnivores, but have a marked preference for meat. Adult females are 4½ to 5 feet tall and weigh up to 300 pounds, while males are larger, being 5½ to 6 feet tall and weighing up to 400 pounds.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Barkling" >

## Barkling

|                 | Barkling                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Armor Class:    | 15 (11)                  |
| Hit Dice:       | 1/2 (1d4 HP)             |
| No. of Attacks: | 1 bite or 1 weapon       |
| Damage:         | 1d4 bite, or by weapon   |
| Movement:       | 20' Unarmored, 40'       |
| No. Appearing:  | 3d4, Wild 4d6, Lair 5d10 |
| Save As:        | Normal Man               |
| Morale:         | 7 (9)                    |
| Treasure Type:  | P, Q each, C, K in Lair  |
| XP:             | 10                       |

Barklings are diminutive furry humanoids with very
dog-like faces. They stand between 2½ and 3½ feet tall
and typically weigh around 45 pounds. They are pack
hunters by nature, shy when encountered singly or in
small groups but bold when their numbers are
overwhelming. Use the higher morale figure when a
barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3
combatants to 1 or more.

Barklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with
weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature
and relative lack of strength; all such weapons do 1d4
points of damage on a hit.

Barklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a
range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they
excel; a barkling can track almost any living or corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been
as much as a day since it passed.

In combat barklings usually wear chainmail armor
which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor
Class given above).

One out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1
hit die (25 XP). In barkling encampments, one out of
every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP)
having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In
villages of 50 or more there will be a barkling lord of 3
hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage.
Barklings gain a +1 bonus to their morale as long as
they are led by any of their leaders.

In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a
wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is
present). A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior
barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level
1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if
it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level
-1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.

Barklings are sometimes confused with kobolds, for
whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a
kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is
considered a terrible insult.

| XP:             | 610                     | 1,085                                   |

A basilisk is a giant six-legged lizard-like monster that
petrifies living creatures with its gaze. A basilisk has
dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale
yellow or white belly. Adults reach a body length of 5
to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a
weight of 250 to 400 pounds. There is no particular
difference in size between males and females.

Any living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must
save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone instantly. In
general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet
its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while
averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2
to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the
monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack
and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own
reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or be
turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to
petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other
reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed,
but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster
with a mirror it may see its reflection.

The greater basilisk appears identical to the common
variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of
about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing
between 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greater
basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living
creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare
skin must save vs. Poison or die. This effect persists
even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20
hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to
touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea.

## Bat (and Bat, Giant)

Bats are nocturnal flying mammals. The statistics presented here describe small, insectivorous bats. They have a natural sonar that allows them to operate in total darkness; for game purposes, treat this ability as Darkvision.

A group of normal-sized bats has no effective attack (at least in terms of doing damage) but can confuse those in the area, flying around apparently randomly. For every ten bats in the area, one creature can be confused; such a creature will suffer a penalty of -2 on all attack and saving throw rolls while the bats remain in the area.

A giant bat has a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs about 200 pounds. They have the same sensory abilities as normal-sized bats, but being much larger, they are able to attack adventurers; many are carnivorous, making such attacks likely.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Bear" >

## Bear

Bears attack by rending opponents with their claws, dragging them in and biting them. A successful hit with both paws indicates a hug attack for additional damage (as given for each specific bear type). All bears are very tough to kill, and are able to move and attack for one round after losing all hit points.

Giant bees live in hives, generally in underground areas.
In each such hive will be a queen who has 2 hit dice and
inflicts only a bite doing 1d8 points of damage. She is
immobile, and if she is threatened all bees in the hive will
fight without checking morale. The queen is worth 75 XP
if defeated.

Those stung by a giant bee must save vs. Poison or die. A
giant bee that successfully stings another creature pulls
away, leaving its stinger in the creature; the bee then dies.

Each giant bee hive will contain honeycomb filled with
honey, which is entirely safe to eat and is worth 10 GP per
gallon if carefully removed. Generally 2d10+10 gallons of
honey will be present in any given hive. There is also a
15% chance that one of the cells in the honeycomb will
contain special honey which acts as 1d6+1 [Potions of Healing](magicItems.qmd#potions) if consumed. This honey can be discovered by chance, or through the use of [detect magic](allSpells.qmd#detect-magic).

Giant bombardier beetles have red head and thorax sections and black abdomens. They are 3 to 4 feet long. In combat, a giant bombardier beetle bites opponents in front of it, and sprays a cone of very hot and noxious gases from a nozzle in the rearmost tip of the abdomen. This toxic blast causes 2d6 points of damage to all within a cone 10' long and 10' wide at the far end (a save vs. Death Ray for half damage is allowed). A giant bombardier beetle can use this spray attack up to five times per day, but no more often than once per three rounds. Faced with opponents attacking from just one direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to turn away and use the spray attack rather than biting.

Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have more or less the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.

Giant fire beetles are huge, being 18 to 30 inches long,
and have shiny black carapaces. Each has a pair of
glowing red organs located just below their eyes which
illuminate a radius of 10 feet around the creature.
These glands continue to glow for 1d6 days after one is
killed, and may be removed and used for illumination
by any adventurers not too squeamish to do so.

They are normally timid but will fight if cornered. Like
most beetles, they have more or less the same visual
acuity in all directions, and thus those who attack them
from behind receive no bonus to do so.

Giant oil beetles are about 3 feet long, and are often
found burrowing in soil or roaming dungeon corridors.
Their eyes are arranged on the sides of their heads such
that they can see perfectly well behind them as well as
in front, negating any normal bonus for attacking from
behind.

In addition to its bite, a giant oil beetle can attack with a
spray of oil from its abdomen; this can only be applied
to opponents within 5 feet of the back of the beetle,
and an attack roll is needed to hit. Living creatures hit
by this spray suffer a penalty of -2 on all attack rolls for
24 hours due to painful blisters inflicted by the irritating
oil. A [cure light wounds](allSpells.qmd#cure-light-wounds) spell may be used to remove
this effect, but if so used the spell does not also restore
hit points to the victim

Giant tiger beetles are predatory monsters around 5 feet long. Their carapaces tend to be dark brown with lighter brown striped or spotted patterns, but there are many variations.

They are fast runners, depending on their speed to run down prey, and they willingly prey on any creature of man size or smaller. Like most beetles, they have more or less the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.

Blink dogs, also known as flicker beasts, are strange
creatures which resemble wolves or hyenas who can
teleport up to 120 feet at will. Teleportation is so easy
for them that they can sometimes teleport away before
being attacked; specifically, when a flicker beast know
of the attacker’ presence. The flicker beast is allowed a
saving throw vs. Death Ray, and on a successful roll
teleports 1d6 x 10 feet in a random direction (but never
into solid matter, nor into any dangerous area the
creature knows about).

These creatures are pack hunters, using their
teleportation to confuse their prey until they are able to
surround it. In this way, some members of the pack will
be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good
at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to
hit and double damage if the hit is successful.

Blink dogs are large canines, typically light brown in
color with short bristly hair; some varieties are striped or
spotted. They communicate using a language of barks,
growls, and yips which is somewhat limited but can
convey useful tactical information. They are shy,
generally avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate
[deceivers](monstersAll.qmd#deceiver-panther-hydra) and will generally attack them on sight.

Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually animated plants, dimly aware of their surroundings. These plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.

The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30' from the plant in ideal conditions. Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save vs. Poison or become befuddled; such a victim will drop anything carried and try to approach the plant. Each round an unaffected living creature can smell the fragrance it must make this save. Befuddled creatures will not resist the attacks of the blood rose; if affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters, constructs, etc. are not affected.

Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded with thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day) "eaten" in this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed.

Wild boars are the natural variety of swine. They are surly and aggressive, prone to attacking characters just because they are present. Note that "boar" refers specifically to the male of the species, but females are equally large and fierce, more so if they have offspring.

Wild boars have stocky and muscular bodies, covered with bristly hair which may be black, brown, or gray in color. Those in colder climates will have an under-layer of warm fur, while those found in warmer areas will not.

Bugbears look like huge, hairy goblins, standing about 6 feet tall. Their eyes are usually a darkish brown color and they move very quietly. They are wild and cruel, and bully smaller humanoids whenever possible.

Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant. They are able to move in nearly complete silence, surprising opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. In order to remain silent, they must wear only leather or hide armor, as indicated in the Armor Class scores above. Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage due to their great Strength. As with most goblinoid monsters, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.

One out of every eight bugbears will be a hardened warrior of 4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to damage. In lairs of 16 or more bugbears, there will be a chieftain of 6+6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with a +3 bonus to damage. Bugbears gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a hardened warrior or chieftain. In the lair, bugbears never fail a morale check as long as the chieftain is alive. In addition, there is a 2 in 6 chance that a shaman will be present in a lair. A shaman is equal to an ordinary bugbear statistically, but possesses 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities.

Caecilia are carnivorous, legless amphibians; they strongly resemble earthworms, but they have bony skeletons and sharp teeth. Caecilia live entirely underground. The giant variety grows up to 30' long and frequently are found in caverns or dungeons. They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.

A caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid or demi-human (such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers 1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit, fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to the attack roll are applied.

Once a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and digest its meal.

Cattle are large mammals with cloven hooves and
horned heads. Cattle are raised mostly for their meat
(beef), leather, and milk. Cattle eat grass and are fairly
gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede
(run in a group). Anyone caught in the path of the
stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as
determined by the GM. Male cattle are called bulls,
females are cows, and young are calves (calf is
singular). If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using
their horns to attack. Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less
easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure),
and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd. A bull
will likely attack if he sees quick movements from
creatures he might be able to reach with a charge.
Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a
roughly circular formation with their heads outward,
while calves will be kept in the center, though if the
opponents are small enough they may instead charge
en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.

A typical small farm with cattle will have a bull, 5d4
cows, and 2d10 calves (but not more than the number
of cows).

Aurochs are wild cattle; they are shaggy and rough-
looking. Bison are the largest species of wild bovines.
All types of bovines tend to behave in the same general
way, as described above.

An ox is typically a castrated bull used as a draft animal;
females may be used, rarely, but males are preferred
due to their greater size and strength. Oxen are usually
paired as a team to pull a fully-loaded wagon (or the
equivalent of 3,000 lb). Oxen require less food and
water, being able to eat rough grass better than draft
horses, which makes them valuable to merchants with
large caravans going over semi-arid prairie.

Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that live underground. An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long. They are eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a variety of touch-sensitive "hairs" on their legs to sense the environment around them.

These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.

All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed, attracting wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.

Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not interrupt the monster's shrieking.

A giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to 30' up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.

Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10' away. Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell.

Cavemen are a species closely related to humans; they are shorter and stockier, and much more heavily muscled. They do not all actually live in caves. Whether they are actually less intelligent than "normal" humans or not is a matter of debate, but it is true that they do not have the facility for language as other human, demi-human and humanoid races.

Centaurs appear to be half man, half horse, having the torso, arms and head of a man in the position a horse's head would otherwise occupy. A centaur is as big as a heavy horse, but much taller and slightly heavier; average males are about 7 feet tall and weigh about 2,100 pounds, and females are just a bit smaller. Centaurs may charge with a spear or lance just as a man on horseback, with the same bonuses. They typically wear leather armor when prepared for combat.

Centaurs are generally haughty and aloof, but very honorable. Most would rather die than allow humans, demi-humans, or humanoids to ride on their backs.

Giant centipedes are larger versions of the normal sort, being 2 to 3 feet long. Centipedes are fast-moving, predatory, venomous arthropods, having long segmented bodies with exoskeletons. They prefer to live in underground areas, shadowy forested areas, and other places out of direct sunlight; however, there are desert-dwelling varieties that hide under the sand waiting for prey to wander by.

These creatures are aggressive and always hungry, attacking any living creature and only checking morale if injured. Giant centipedes attack with a poisonous bite, and those bitten must save vs. Poison or die; however, the poison is somewhat weak and thus grants a bonus of +2 on the saving throw.

A Cheetah is one of the fastest land animals - a large (about 100 pounds) cat capable of reaching up to 75 miles per hour when running. It hunts alone or in small groups (usually composed of siblings). It will rarely attack humans unless compelled to do so, but a female will ferociously defend her young.

Chimeras are strange creatures having a lion's body with the heads of a lion, a goat, and a dragon, and the wings of a dragon. A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera's dragon head might be black, blue, green, red, or white, and has the same type of breath weapon as that sort of dragon. Regardless of type, the dragon's head breathes a 50' long cone with a 10' wide end, for 3d6 points of damage; victims may save vs. Dragon Breath for one-half damage.

Chimeras are cruel and voracious. They can speak Dragon but seldom bother to do so, except when toadying to more powerful creatures.

A cockatrice is a strange creature, appearing to be a chicken (hen or rooster) with a long serpentine neck and tail; the neck is topped by a more or less normal looking chicken head.

A male cockatrice has wattles and a comb, just like a rooster. Females, much rarer than males, differ only in that they have no wattles or comb. A cockatrice weighs about 25 pounds. A cockatrice is no more intelligent than any animal, but they are bad-tempered and prone to attack if disturbed.

Anyone touched by a cockatrice, or who touches one (even if gloved), must save vs. Petrification or be turned to stone.

Giant crabs naturally resemble the ordinary variety, but are much larger, averaging 5' in diameter (not counting their legs). These creatures are often found in water-filled caves, particularly those connected to a river, lake or sea, and are tolerant of both fresh and salt water. Also, they are able to live in stagnant water, though they prefer a better environment.

Giant crabs carry their eyes on armored stalks, which means that no bonus is awarded for attacking them from behind.

Crocodiles are aggressive predators 11 to 12 feet long. They lie mostly submerged in rivers or marshes, with only their eyes and nostrils showing, waiting for prey to come within reach; when in their natural element, they surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.

**Large Crocodiles:** These huge creatures are from 12-20 feet long. Large crocodiles fight and behave like their smaller cousins.

Deceivers are greenish-black catlike monsters with thick serpents extending from their shoulders.  All three of the monster's mouths can bite, though the smaller serpent heads do not do as much damage. 

The real power and danger of the deceiver is its power of **deception**, a mental ability which causes those attacking the monster to believe the creature is about 3 feet from its true location.  Any character fighting a deceiver for the first time will miss their first strike regardless of the die roll.  Thereafter, all attacks against deceivers will be at a penalty of -2 to the attack roll. This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind.  As a mental power, this ability does not affect mindless creatures, constructs such as golems or living statues, or any sort of undead.  Living creatures which are not mindless will be affected even if they do not use sight to target the deceiver. 

**Greater Deceivers** are larger and more fierce than common Deceivers, and on top of that, their serpent heads have a deadly venomous bite; victims must save vs. Poison or die.

The Deinonychus (sometimes mistakenly called a "Velociraptor") is a medium-sized feathered dinosaur weighting approximately 150 pounds and reaching about 11 feet of length (tail included). It is an avid predator and a skilled pack-hunter; its warm blood, aerodynamic build and vicious maw allow it to feed on larger but more primitive dinosaurs.

Although fearsome looking, the stegosaurus is actually a
peaceable creature and will only fight in self-defense,
either biting, trampling, or using its spiked tail,
depending on where the opponent is standing in
relation to the dinosaur. A stegosaurus can't use its tail
and bite attacks against the same creature in the same

A triceratops is a three-horned herbivorous dinosaur.
They are aggressive toward interlopers, attacking
anyone who might appear to be a threat. Individuals
are quite large, weighing 11,000 to 20,000 pounds and
ranging from 26 to 30 feet in length.

When facing opponents of smaller size, a triceratops will
usually attempt to trample them, reserving the gore
attack for larger opponents. Up to two adjacent man-
sized or up to four smaller opponents may be trampled
simultaneously; the triceratops rolls a single attack roll
which is compared to the Armor Class of each of the
potential victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll
for each one successfully hit. The gore attack may only
be used against a single man-sized or larger creature,
but may be used in the same round as the trample if
the creature being gored is larger than man sized. Also
note that a charging bonus may be applied to the gore
attack.

The tyrannosaurus rex is a bipedal carnivorous
dinosaur with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy
tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, its
forelimbs are short but unusually powerful for their size,
with two clawed digits. Despite this, they are not used
to attack, as the tyrannosaur's powerful bite is its
preferred weapon.

Individuals can grow to lengths of over 40 feet and can
weigh up to 20,000 pounds, though most are a bit
smaller than this, averaging around 35 feet in length
and 17,000 pounds in weight.

The statistics above can also be used to represent other
large bipedal carnosaurs, such as the allosaurus.

The djinn (singular djinni) are humanoid creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air. A djinni in its natural form is about 10½ feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind (see below) to harass those who follow; the 12 morale reflects a djinni's absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the "8" figure to determine whether an outmatched djinn decides to leave a combat.

Djinn have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): **create food and drink**, creating tasty and nourishing food for up to 2d6 humans or similar creatures, once per day; become **invisible**, with unlimited uses per day; **create normal items**, creating up to 1,000 pounds of soft goods or wooden items of permanent nature or metal goods lasting at most a day, once per day; assume **gaseous form**, as the potion, up to one hour per day; and **create illusions**, as the spell **phantasmal force** but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day.

Djinn may assume the form of a whirlwind at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; a djinni in whirlwind form fights as if it were an air elemental.

Due to their highly magical nature, djinn cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal cold, and suffer only half damage from magical attacks based on either cold or wind.

Normal dogs include most medium and large breeds, including wild dogs. After biting an opponent, a dog can hold on, doing 1d4 damage automatically every round, until killed or until the victim spends an attack breaking free (which requires a save vs. Death Ray, adjusted by the character's Strength bonus).

Riding dogs are a large breed, used primarily by Halflings for transport. They may be trained for war, and equipped with barding to improve their Armor Class. They can maintain a hold in the same way that normal dogs do. A light load for a riding dog is up to 150 pounds; a heavy load, up to 300 pounds.

Dopplegangers are weird humanoid creatures who are
able to take on the appearance of nearly any other
humanoid ranging from 3 feet up to 7 feet in height.
They can also read minds (as the spell, **mind reading**,
but with unlimited duration), an ability that can even be
used to speak any language known to the creature
whose mind is being read. In their natural form (which
few creatures ever see) they are pale and pasty looking,
slim, around 5½ feet tall and weighing about 150
pounds. Their features look unformed and incomplete.

Dopplegangers wish to live a life of ease, and in pursuit
of that goal they will seek to take the place of any
character they meet who they believe can help them get
that kind of life. This usually means separating the
victim from any allies and quietly killing them. While a
doppleganger can duplicate the appearance of the
clothing and equipment worn by a creature, such items
are part of the creature and cannot, for example, be
laid down or handed to someone. Taking the clothing
and equipment of a victim is thus the preferred tactic.

A doppleganger can mimic the sound of the voice of
any living creature as well as the appearance of any
humanoid. Their **mind reading** ability will be used to
help them behave like the person they have replaced.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Dragon" >

## Dragon

Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish "true" dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven "age categories," ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.

If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.

In combat dragons use a powerful bite, slashing claws, a long, whiplike tail, and most famously some form of breath weapon. Tactically, dragons prefer to fight while flying, making passes over ground-based enemies to strike or breathe on them. Smarter and older dragons will look for the toughest or most dangerous foe to strike down first, particularly preferring to eliminate magic-users as early in a fight as possible.

Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail in the same round. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.

The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.

There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a "normal" shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon can produce all three shapes.

The shapes are: 

**Cone Shaped:** The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).

**Line Shaped:** The breath weapon is 5' wide (regardless of the given width figure) and extends the given length in a straight line.

**Cloud Shaped:** The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, any length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.

All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of "talking;" this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or some other humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for "talking" is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.

Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.

All dragons crave wealth, hoarding as many coins, gems, items of jewelry, and best of all magic items in their lair as possible. The greater a dragon's hoard, the less it will seek to leave its lair, though of course it must hunt for food from time to time. Dragons rarely trust any other creature to defend their hoard, though some will entice aggressive but unintelligent creatures to live nearby in the hopes that they will kill and eat any thieves who might come nosing around.

Unlike other monsters, multiple dragons encountered in a lair together do not share treasure; generate a full treasure for each dragon individually. Treasure for dragons is special, as noted on the treasure section . The odds of monetary treasure increase with the monster's age category, while the chances of gems, jewelry, and magic items are based upon its hit dice.

Young dragons typically have brightly colored, glossy skin; as a dragon ages, both the color and the sheen slowly become dull.
Experience Points (XP) given for dragons on the following pages are for non-spell-casting dragons of age category 4.  The GM must calculate the XP award for any specific dragon as given in the [character advancement section](advancement.qmd#experience-points-xp), adding a special ability bonus (i.e. a "star") if the dragon casts spells.

Cloud dragons have the most varied appearance of all the true dragons. In an indoor environment or when underground a cloud dragon appears to be a bright metallic color, while outdoors their coloration is brighter and less metallic, and may take on a reddish or bluish cast reminiscent of a sunrise or sunset. Hatchlings have a coppery skin tone, brightening to silver at the second age category, then to gold at the fourth before fading to a platinum tone by age category 6. While most true dragons become duller in color and sheen as they age, cloud dragons do not.

Cloud dragons are not cruel and do not seek to kill for pleasure. Many tales are told of cloud dragons offering assistance to adventurers, though they are every bit as avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold need not bother asking for a loan.

Another way in which cloud dragons differ from other types is that they do not have fixed breath weapons. Upon reaching the second age category, a cloud dragon acquires the breath weapon of a randomly-chosen (or GM assigned) dragon type; upon reaching the fourth age category, they acquire a second breath weapon type. Cloud dragons possess the same immunities as the dragons whose breath weapons they reproduce.

All cloud dragons have the power to assume the form of any type of humanoid (as described in the spell [charm person](allSpells.qmd#charm-person)) at will in a manner otherwise equivalent to the spell [polymorph self](allSpells.qmd#polymorph-self).

Desert dragons have rough, gritty-feeling hide which is a dark steel blue color with a smoother, streaky brown underbelly. Their bodies are wiry and serpentine.

They hunt by day in the heat of the sun, sometimes flying high overhead looking for prey, or sometimes choosing to bury themselves in the sand and lie in wait with only eyes and nostrils exposed. One will wait in this fashion until victims come within 100 feet, then spring out and attack (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).

A desert dragon will usually choose to lair in an underground cavern, or perhaps in a ruined castle or desert outpost. They are evil monsters, though not so fierce as mountain dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a desert dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person as a cat plays with a mouse.

Desert dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.

Forest dragons are bright leaf green in color, with a tan underbelly. They have long sinuous bodies and move with catlike grace. They are cruel monsters, but they are renowned for their curiosity. They especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby. Adventurers may be allowed to live so long as they remain interesting... but woe to them when the dragon becomes bored.

Forest dragons are immune to all poisons. Note that, despite their breath weapon being described as "poison gas," damage done by it is exactly the same as with other dragons. More specifically, those in the area of effect do not have to "save or die" as with ordinary poison, but rather save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage.

Ice dragons have pale blue-white skin, ranging from sky blue for a hatchling to the stark pure white of an ancient individual. They are the same color all over, having no contrasting underbelly color.

They prefer to live in cold regions, whether in the highest mountains or in the cold northern lands. They are the least intelligent of dragons, though this does not mean that they are stupid by any stretch of the imagination. They are motivated completely by a drive to live, to reproduce, and (of course) to accumulate treasure; they kill to live, not for pleasure.

In a fashion similar to swamp and desert dragons, an ice dragon will sometimes choose to bury itself in snow and wait, with only its eyes and nostrils exposed, in a place where prey is likely to pass by. The ice dragon will then burst out when likely prey approaches within 100', surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6.

Ice dragons are immune to normal cold, and take only half damage from magical cold or ice.

Mountain dragons are red in color, ranging from the brilliant blood red of a hatchling to the dull terracotta color of an ancient individual. These dragons are powerfully built, with heavy-jawed heads and thick muscular bodies, yet their necks are still long enough to give them the legendary flexibility of a true dragon.

They are cruel monsters, actively seeking to hunt, torment, kill and consume intelligent creatures. They are often said to prefer women and elves, but in truth a mountain dragon will attack almost any creature less powerful than itself.

They are intelligent and self-assured, but also impatient and overconfident. One will often plan strategies in advance and then choose one at random when facing unknown opponents, without regard to whether or not the strategy is likely to work. The sheer power of a mountain dragon is often the only reason one is still alive.

Mountain dragons are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire.

Plains dragons are the smallest of the true dragons. They have yellow skin dappled with light green patches, spots, or sometimes thin stripes. The color dulls and darkens with age until it reaches an almost uniform tan color at the oldest age category. They have long sinuous bodies and unusually long legs, giving them the fastest land movement rate of any dragon, but they are also accomplished fliers, as fast and maneuverable as any dragon.

Plains dragons may hunt on the wing, attacking suddenly from above and surprising on 1-3 on 1d6; or, they may lie in wait in tall grass or a copse of trees, using their coloration as camouflage. As one ages and its colors dull, this ability improves; when lying in wait, they gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 at age categories 2 and 3, on 1-4 in age categories 4 through 6, and on 1-5 at age category 7.

The breath weapon of the plains dragon is a scorching, shimmering cone of heat, barely visible to the naked eye; at night, however, a glow like steel being forged can be seen streaming from the dragon's open mouth.

Young sea dragons are light bluish-gray in color (similar to dolphins), darkening to a deep slate color in older individuals. Their skin is smooth and sleek, and their bodies are more compact than most dragons, though their long neck gives them the same flexibility.

Though they live in the water and are somewhat adapted to it, sea dragons still must breathe air, similar to dolphins or whales. A sea dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while swimming or performing other moderate activity.

These dragons have much the same physical structure as other dragons, but their feet are webbed and their tails are short, flat and broad; these adaptations help the sea dragon swim efficiently, but severely limit their ability to walk on dry land. Unlike other dragons, sea dragons do not have a tail attack. The breath weapon of a sea dragon is a cloud of steam; they are immune to damage from non-magical steam (including the breath weapon of another sea dragon), and suffer only half damage from magical steam attacks.

Sea dragons are neutral in outlook, in much the same way as ice dragons. They often maintain lairs in air-filled undersea caverns.

Swamp dragons have green skin so dark as to appear to be black, especially in uncertain light or while wet. They often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).

Though swamp dragons are more cruel than ice dragons, they are still motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items.

Swamp dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A swamp dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while lying in wait underwater.

Dragon turtles are so large, up to 200 feet long, that they are occasionally mistaken for rocky outcroppings or even small islands. Though they are not true dragons, they do advance through the same sort of age categories as the true dragons do; however, each age category changes the dragon turtle's Hit Dice by 5.

Due to their massive size, dragon turtles are immune to virtually all poisons.

Dryads are female nature spirits; each is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad’s oak does not radiate magic. A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.

A dryad resembles an elf woman, with skin like fine polished wood or smooth bark and hair like leaves; the hair color of a dryad usually changes with the seasons, being brown in the winter, pale green in the spring, darker green in the summer, and yellow, orange, or red in the fall.

Though they are usually content to live alone, dryads are often friends with creatures such as treant or other nature spirits who might live nearby. Once per day a dryad can cast a charm similar to the spell **charm person**, and one may choose to use this ability to compel an interesting human or elf to remain with her as a companion for a period of up to a year. The companion can be taken into and brought out of the dryad's tree so long as the charm is still in effect.

Eagles are large birds with wingspans 6½ to 7½ feet in
width. They stand about 2½ to 3 feet tall and weigh
about 13 lbs. These birds have heavy talons and large
beaks with a sharp hooked end. Eagles are known to
carry prey up to 15 lbs. An eagle will also kill and start 
to eat animals that are 5 times the eagles size, up to 80
lbs. The largest eagles tend to be fish-eating or sea
eagles, while other types of eagles will eat snakes or
small animals. Coloring is dependent on the species of
eagle from dark browns with a white head, to fully
brown, to various grays ranging from black to white.
The beaks can be bright yellowish orange to black.
Eagles will fly at a prey and attack with both sets of
talons, then attack with the beak.

An average giant eagle has a wingspan of 15 to 20 feet
and stands 8 to 12 feet tall. They are intelligent
creatures, and many speak Common or another
language common in their home territory.

Individual giant eagles are rarely encountered alone, as
they prefer to live in loose communities. However,
when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with
each eagle choosing a single creature as prey. As they
can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare
for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the
same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack
alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more
easily choose a victim.

Giant eagles mate for life. If a nest with eggs or
hatchlings is threatened, both parents will fight without
checking morale, and other giant eagles in their
community may come to their defense but will still seek
to scatter any opponents so as to attack them one on
one

The efreet (singular efreeti) are humanoid creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire. An efreeti in its natural form stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Efreet are malicious by nature. They love to mislead, befuddle, and confuse their foes. They do this for enjoyment as much as for tactical reasons.

Note that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti's absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the "9" figure to determine whether an outmatched efreeti decides to leave a combat.

Efreet have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): become **invisible**, with unlimited uses per day; assume **gaseous form**, as the potion, up to one hour per day; **create illusions**, as the spell **phantasmal force** but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day; **create flame**, with unlimited uses; and create a **wall of fire** (as the spell), once per day. Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torchflame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60', causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit. The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well if desired, once per round.

Efreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.

Due to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire attacks.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Elemental*" >

## Elemental*

An elemental is a being formed from one of the
foundational elements of reality. In Western traditions,
the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water;
Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth,
metal, water, and wood. This book presents the full
range needed for either tradition, and to those types are
added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish
to be less traditional. As always, the Game Master
decides what sort of monsters appear in their world,
and so not all of the following creatures may be
encountered.

Each type of elemental may be summoned to the
material plane by means of one of three different
methods:

Conjured by the 5th level Magic-User spell [conjure elemental](allSpells.qmd#conjure-elemental); or,

Summoned by means of a magical **staff**; or,

Summoned by a device (as given in the [Miscellaneous Magic](magicItems.qmd#miscellaneous-magic-items) subsection of the Treasure section of this book.

These three types of elementals are quite reasonably
called staff, device, and conjured elementals. The hit
dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:

| Type     | Hit Dice |
| -------- | -------- |
| Staff    | 8        |
| Device   | 12       |
| Conjured | 16       |


The summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it
to control it, and may take no other action, including
attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be
lost. Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the
uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the
summoner and attack.

Elementals must be summoned from a large quantity of
the appropriate natural material. For example, air
elementals require a large quantity of air (so small
underground spaces will not support the summoning of
one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or
stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a
castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire
such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access
to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river
or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work).
Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other
elemental of the same type may be summoned in the
same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.

Non-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental.
Attacks made by an elemental should be considered
magical for purposes of determining how much damage
creatures resistant to the elemental's attack form should
suffer.

Generally, elementals are immune to both normal and
magical forms of their own attack form. Most are more
susceptible to attacks from one or two specific other
types of elemental; this is noted in the text for each
type.

Air elementals resemble "dust devils," that is, small whirlwinds, but they are much more powerful. Air elementals take double damage when attacked by earth-based attacks (including by earth elementals). An air elemental may choose either to attack a single opponent, thus receiving one attack per round at the listed damage, or may choose to knock all opponents in a 5' radius to the ground; if the latter attack is used, all creatures of 2 hit dice or less must save vs. Death Ray or fall prone. Creatures of 3 or more levels or hit dice are not so affected. Air elementals do an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures or vehicles which are airborne.

A cold elemental resembles a crude, headless ice statue
with long sharp icicles in place of hands. A cold
elemental suffers double damage from fire attacks,
including the attacks of fire elementals. It deals an
additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures that
are hot or flaming in nature, as well as creatures made
of liquids or jelly. A cold elemental's body is so bitterly
cold that creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of
damage automatically, unless they are immune to the
effects of cold. Any liquids the cold elemental touches
immediately freeze solid. A cold elemental cannot enter
places where the temperature is above 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, and if forced to do so will suffer 1d6 points
of damage each round.

Fire elementals are simply flames, which may appear generally humanoid for brief moments when they attack. Fire elementals take double damage when attacked by water (including water elementals). They cannot cross a body of water wider than their own diameter. They do an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures which are cold or icy in nature.

Remember that a fire elemental is constantly burning; such a creature may easily start fires if it moves into an area containing items which burn easily, such as dry wood, paper, or oil. No specific rules are given for such fires, but the GM is directed to the rules for burning oil for an example of fire damage.

A lightning elemental resembles dark clouds lit from
within by flashes of lightning. One can magnetically
draw metal items towards itself as if using [telekinesis](allSpells.qmd#telekinesis).
It deals 1d8 extra points of damage to creatures that are
in contact with water or metal but not touching solid
ground. A lightning elemental takes double damage
when attacked by air or wind attacks (including air
elementals), and from the attacks of wood elementals
as well. A lightning elemental can choose either to
strike a single creature or create a mighty thunderclap.
If the latter attack is used, all creatures within a 30 foot
radius must save vs. Paralysis or be deafened for 1d8
turns

Metal elementals appear to be somewhat abstract
humanoid figures formed from metal. They are able to
move as if liquid, though they are cool and hard to the
touch. Their semi-liquid form permits them to form
their extremities into wickedly sharp blades, which is
their preferred means of attack. Those wearing metal
armor receive no protection against a metal elemental
(except for magical bonuses, if any); indeed, on a
successful hit one deals an additional 1d8 points of
damage to creatures, vehicles, or structures that are
made of or in direct contact with some form of metal.
Lightning attacks deal double damage to a metal
elemental. Like an earth elemental, a metal elemental
cannot cross a body of water greater than its own
height.

Water elementals resemble roiling waves of water,
which seem to fall upon any creature attacked, only to
reform the next round. They take double damage
when attacked with air or wind attacks (including air
elementals). A water elemental cannot move more
than 60' from a body of water. They do an extra 1d8
points of damage against creatures, vehicles, or

medium size; large opponents may be targeted by three
of these attacks in a round. However, an elephant can
attack multiple opponents in its immediate area at the
same time.

An elephant has no treasure as such, but the tusks of an
elephant are worth 1d8 x 100 gp each.

Falcons are birds with wingspans of 16 to 20 inches;
they stand about 1.5 to 2 feet tall and weigh about 3
pounds. These are the most popular of the hunting
birds used by royalty. Falcons can only carry prey up
to 1 pound. They will hunt snakes, small rodents, and
even other birds such as wild ducks. Falcons appear in
a variety of colors, typically ranging from dark gray on
top to white with dark stripes on the bottom; kestrels, a
variety of falcon, have reddish brown to dark brown
feathers with dark stripes. A falcon typically attacks
prey by diving, striking first with the talons before
making the kill with its sharp beak.

Barracuda are predatory fish found in salt water. Huge barracudas are about 12' long, while giant specimens can exceed 20'. They have elongated bodies, pointed heads and prominent jaws. Their bodies are covered with smooth scales, typically blue, gray or silver in color. They have extremely keen eyesight and are surprised only on a 1 on 1d6. Due to the quickness of their attack, barracudas are themselves capable of surprising on 1-3 on 1d6 and gain a +2 bonus to Initiative.

Giant barracudas always appear singly and are 50% likely to break off the attack after 1d4 rounds if they haven't killed their prey. Both kinds are attracted to shiny objects.

Giant bass are generally between 10' and 25' long. Most are greenish-grey, marked with dark lateral stripes, though some are almost completely black. They are generally found in lakes or rivers, as they are not adapted for salt water.

Giant bass are predatory, and on a natural attack roll of 20 a giant bass will swallow whole a dwarf-sized or smaller creature, which then takes 2d4 damage per round until it is dead. Swallowed characters can attack only with daggers or similar short weapons. Note that each giant bass can swallow at most one character, and a giant bass which has swallowed a character will attempt to retreat (having achieved its goal).

Giant catfish fins are edged with a natural poison that causes a painful burning sensation for 3d10 rounds if a save vs. Poison is failed. The pain causes the affected character or creature to suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws; further poisonings will increase this penalty by -1 each, down to a maximum penalty of -5 as well as adding 6 rounds to the duration of the poison effect.

Because of its large size (15 to 20 feet long) and body design, a giant catfish cannot target more than one of its attacks on any single creature; that is, it cannot bite and fin the same opponent, nor use both fins on one victim.

Giant frogs are enlarged versions of the common frog; most resemble bullfrogs in appearance, but an adult giant frog is 3' long and weighs about 250 pounds. They are predators, but will normally only attack creatures smaller than themselves. Giant toads are statistically just like giant frogs; however, they are often found in "drier" areas as they do not have to maintain a wet skin surface.

A giant frog can stretch its tongue out up to 15' and drag up to dwarf-sized prey to its mouth; on every subsequent round, the victim is hit automatically. On a natural 20 attack roll, the victim is swallowed whole, taking 1d6 damage per round thereafter. Each giant frog can swallow only one such victim.

Gargoyles are demonic-looking winged humanoid monsters with gray stone-like skin. They can remain still for an extended period, and are thus often mistaken for stone statues. Gargoyles use this disguise to ambush their foes, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 if their foes do not otherwise suspect them. They are cruel monsters, inflicting pain on other creatures for the sole purpose of enjoyment.

Gargoyles can go for very long periods of time, on the order of decades, without air or sustenance. Due to their highly magical nature, they can only be harmed by magical weapons.

A ghost is the soul or spirit of a deceased sentient creature that has for some reason remained on the material plane. They usually appear as they did in life, but sometimes the appearance of a ghost is altered by its original personality; for instance, the ghost of an angry person might have a threatening or even demonic visage. Ghosts are undead, and as such are immune to **sleep**, **charm**, and **hold magic**.

Seeing a ghost is so terrible that any living creature who does so must save vs. Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. Anyone who successfully makes this save may not be so affected by that ghost again.

A ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8 points of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same number of hit points. In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit. Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the GM should assign whatever score they see fit.

Like most incorporeal creatures, ghosts may normally be hit only by magical weapons. However, if a ghost makes use of its touch attack, it becomes vulnerable to non-magical weapons until the beginning of the next round of combat.

Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of **restoration**; nothing else (except a **wish**) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character's Constitution falls to 0, they die permanently and cannot be **raised** (but still may be **reincarnated**).

Once per turn, a ghost can use **telekinesis** (as the spell) as if it were a 10th level Magic-User.

**Ghouls** are **undead** monsters which eat the flesh of
dead humanoids to survive. They are vile, disgusting
carrion-eaters, but are more than willing to kill for food.
Those slain by ghouls will generally be stored until they
begin to rot before the ghouls will actually eat them.

Living creatures hit by a ghoul’s bite or claw attack
must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns.
Elves are immune to this paralysis. Ghouls try to attack
with surprise whenever possible, striking from behind
tombstones or bursting from shallow graves; when they
attack in this way, they are able to surprise opponents
on 1-3 on 1d6. Like all undead, they may be [Turned](combat.qmd#turning-the-undead)
by Clerics and are immune to [sleep](allSpells.qmd#sleep), [charm](allSpells.qmd#charm-person), and [hold](allSpells.qmd#hold-person) magics.

Humanoids bitten by ghouls may be infected with
ghoul fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a
5% chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted
humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save
is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.

An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a
ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes
a ghoul in this way retains none of the knowledge or
abilities they possessed in life. The newly-risen ghoul is
not under the control of any other ghouls, but hungers
for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other
ghoul in all respects.

**Ghasts** look and fight almost exactly like ghouls, but
they are smarter and just a bit more powerful. Refer to
the previous paragraphs for information about their
claw attacks and other abilities.

The stink of death and corruption surrounding these
creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10
feet must succeed on a save vs. Poison or be sickened
for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls). A creature that
successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same
ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A [neutralize poison](allSpells.qmd#neutralize-poison) spell
removes the effect from a sickened creature.

They may be Turned by Clerics using the same column
as the ghoul, but as they are superior to ghouls, in a
mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GM should apply
Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.

Humanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast
fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10%
chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted
humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save
is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.

An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a
ghast at the next midnight, in a similar fashion to the
ghoul. However, a humanoid who becomes a ghast in
this way retains all of the knowledge and abilities they
possessed in life, unless those abilities are directly
incompatible with the creature's new form (as decided
by the GM). For such ghasts, the GM should also
adjust XP values to include any such abilities. The
newly-risen ghast is not under the control of any other
ghasts, but hungers for the flesh of the living and
behaves like any other ghast in all respects.

Cloud giants are huge, with males averaging 18 feet tall and females 17 feet tall; an adult cloud giant will normally weigh more than 4,750 pounds. They have very pale skin, sometimes with a slight bluish tint, and their hair is bright metallic colors such as silver, brass, or even gold. They have long lives, with most surviving to 400 years barring disease or misadventure.

Cloud giants are often vain, convinced they are the highest form of creation. They wear the finest clothing, make and eat the best food and drink, and live in castles built on high mountains or even in the clouds themselves. Like most giants, they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand tribute from smaller humanoids living nearby.

Despite being self-centered, they fight in highly trained units that use sound tactics; their belief in their own superiority allows no less. Attacking from above is preferred, and ranged attacks are always considered better than melee. To that end, cloud giants can throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage each. Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 8 (2d4). A favorite tactic is to encircle enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells. In battle, cloud giants wear finely crafted, intricately engraved plate mail.

A cyclops is a one-eyed giant. Huge and brutish, they most resemble hill giants, and even dress in the same "style," layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left on, unwashed and unrepaired.

They are reclusive and unfriendly to almost all of the smaller races.

A cyclops can throw a large rock up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage, but they aim poorly and thus suffer an attack penalty of -2. Once per year, a cyclops can cast the spell [bestow curse](allSpells.qmd#remove-curse) (the reverse of the spell **remove curse**).

Despite their great size, fire giants have a Dwarf-like
appearance, being barrel-chested with thick arms and
legs; average males stand 14 feet tall and weigh around
3,200 pounds, while females average 13 feet tall and
around 3,000 pounds. Their skin is ruddy, their hair is
black, and their eyes are a very dark red that is almost
black (and looks that color in poor lighting).

Fire giants are unfriendly to almost all other humanoid
races, though they sometimes subjugate those living
nearby to act as their servants.

In combat they favor heavy plate steel armor (the first
AC given above) made of steel blackened by
quenching in oil. They arm themselves with massive
weapons made of the same material. A fire giant can
throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage.
Fire giants are immune to all fire-based attacks.

Frost giants have pale, almost white skin, blonde or pale blue hair, and bright blue eyes. Average males stand 15 feet tall and weigh around 2,800 pounds, while females average 14 feet tall and 2,500 pounds.

Frost giants are, first and foremost, cunning. They dislike the smaller races as much as any giant, but rather than attacking outright they will try to use their advantages to convince those weaker than them to submit. If faced with a stronger force, frost giants will parley or withdraw if possible, attacking only if victory seems assured.

In combat frost giants prefer brightly-polished steel chainmail worn over their customary clothing of leather and fur (the first AC given above), and weapons of the same material. A frost giant can throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage. Frost giants are immune to all ice or cold-based attacks.

The smallest of giants, adult hill giants stand between 10 and 12 feet in height and weigh about 1,100 pounds. They have medium brown skin, though they are often so dirty as to hide their true skin color; their hair is dark, lank, and greasy, and their eyes are dark as well. They wear crude clothing made of leather; the lack of livestock or game of great enough size often results in whole pelts being stitched together.

Whether attacking with a weapon or st, hill giants deal 2d8 damage. Hill giants are brutish and aggressive. They are sometimes found leading groups of ogres or bugbears. Hill giants often keep **dire wolves** as pets.

Mountain giants are the largest of all giants, with adult
males averaging 24 feet in height and weighing around
16,000 pounds. Females are slightly smaller, standing
22 feet tall on the average and weighing around 14,000
pounds. They look very much like enormous, thickly
built hill giants, and among humans they are often seen
as little more than that. This is underselling the
mountain giants, however, for though their crafting is
primitive they have an intricately detailed social
structure.

Mountain giants live in clans, led by the oldest male and
female (or by their oldest offspring if the elders choose
to delegate leadership due to advanced age). Each clan
rules over and controls a group of 1d6 mountain peaks,
generally spanning an area with a 5-6 mile diameter.
They prefer peaks connected by high ridges so that
they do not have to descend too far when walking their
territory. Clan members who are mated establish
households within the territory; unmarried members
typically live with their parents until they are wed. The
"lair" encounter figures above are for a single
household, but if one household is attacked and the
attackers subsequently retreat, upon their return they
will usually find much of the rest of the clan waiting for
them in ambush.

They wear armor made of wood held together with
heavy rope, and wield giant clubs or staves carved from
fully grown trees harvested from the lower reaches of
their territory. If they live near storm giants, they may
trade for better weapons (the second damage rating
given above) but usually cannot afford storm giant
armor.

A mountain giant can throw large stones up to 240' for
4d6 points of damage each

Stone giants are not the largest of giants, but with an
average adult standing 12 feet tall and weighing roughly
1,500 pounds they are still formidable. There is no
substantial difference in height between males and
females. They usually dress in heavy leather clothing
with sections having been boiled to stiffen them; these
outfits serve as armor and give them the first AC above.
Stone giants are reclusive, but they will defend their
territory (typically in rocky mountainous terrain) against
any who trespass therein.

A stone giant can throw large stones up to 300' for 3d6
points of damage. They will fight in groups to defend
their territory but use only simple, basic tactics and
strategy.

Storm giants are nearly the largest of the giants, with adult males standing 21 feet tall and weighing around 12,000 pounds; adult females average 20 feet and typically weigh around 11,000 pounds. Most storm giants have pale skin and dark hair, but some individuals have skin of a lavender color, and some have pale white or silver hair. Their eyes range from bright blue to deep gray in color.

They prefer to dress in light clothing, such as tunics, sandals, and so on, but in battle they wear finely-crafted plate mail armor of bright metal and wield weapons of the same sort. Their equipment usually appears to be silver but those of the highest class or rank wear armor and bear arms of a bright and shining golden color.

Unlike most other giants, storm giants have been known to befriend humans, elves, or dwarves.

Storm giants have the ability to throw **lightning bolts** as if they were spears (which work just as the spell does, and can be used once per five rounds; a save vs. Spells reduces damage to half). They prefer to attack first with lightning before moving on to other attack forms. Not surprisingly, storm giants are resistant to all forms of lightning or electrical attack, suffering only half damage normal when so attacked.

Also note that 10% of storm giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 12 (2d6).

Gnolls are large fur-covered humanoids, averaging 7½ feet in height and weighing about 300 pounds. They are best recognized by their heads, which resemble those of hyenas (or perhaps wolves) but with shorter muzzles than either.

Gnolls are nocturnal and have Darkvision with a 30' range. They are cruel carnivores, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. They show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader.

One out of every six gnolls will be a hardened warrior of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. Gnolls gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by such a warrior. In lairs of 12 or greater, there will be a pack leader of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP) having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, gnolls never fail a morale check as long as the pack leader is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present, and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hardened warrior statistically, and in addition has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular gnoll, and has Magic-User abilities of level 1d4.

Gnomes are humanoids distantly related to dwarves; they have a similar appearance, but are smaller (averaging 3 to 3½ feet tall and weighing 40 to 45 pounds) and less stocky. Their ears are pointed, not in as pronounced a fashion as elves but certainly noticeable, and their noses likewise are pointed a bit more than those of most other kinds of humanoids. Their preferred habitat is the forest, preferably in a hilly temperate region.

They have Darkvision with a 30' range. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain they are able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20% chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.

Gnomes have their own language, and many also know the language of the dwarves. Some gnomes make their living as traders, often acting as go-betweens for dwarves and humans, and those gnomes naturally tend to learn Common. Those who are engaged in defending their forest settlements from humanoid incursions often choose to learn Goblin or Orc.

Gnomes encountered in the wilderness (who are not traders or merchants) are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure.

The statistics given above are for warriors. In a settlement or lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2 on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics use 1d6 hit dice and Magic-Users use 1d4 hit dice, and in all other ways behave as if they were normal characters.

Goblins are small, reputedly wicked humanoids. They are cunning and vicious, and very sneaky. Adult goblins are 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds, with very little difference between males and females. Their skin color ranges from gray to green, and their eyes are usually bright and crafty-looking, varying in color from red to yellow.

All goblins have Darkvision with a 30' range.

The statistics given above are for a standard Goblin in leather armor with a shield; they have a natural Movement rate of 30' and a natural Armor Class of 11.

Some goblins ride **dire wolves** into combat, and large groups of goblins will often employ them to track and attack their foes.

One out of every eight goblins will be a warrior of 3-3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Goblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In a lair or other settlement, one out of every fifteen will be a chieftain of 5-5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and movement of 10' that gains a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs or settlements of 30 or more goblins, there will be a goblin king of 7-7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 16 (11), wearing chainmail and carrying a shield, with a movement of 10', and having a +1 bonus to damage. Goblins have a +2 bonus to morale while their king is present (this is not cumulative with the bonus given by a warrior leader). In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a goblin king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular goblin statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Golem*" >

## Golem*

Golems are a kind of construct, a creature created from
non-living matter and animated by application of magic.
The powers required to animate a golem are
prodigious, and involve summoning, capturing, and
binding an elemental spirit to the constructed body.
This process also binds the golem to the will of its
creator.

They are mindless, and thus immune to magics
affecting the mind such as sleep, charm, hold, and any
form of mind reading or telepathy. They must be
given explicit, detailed instructions verbally, and the
controller must usually be within 60 feet of the golem to
do so. If not actively being commanded, a golem will
follow the last instructions given to it until the controller
returns. If such a golem is attacked, it will fight in its
own defense but will usually not pursue the attackers if
they flee. The controller can order the golem to follow
the commands of another, but can always resume
control if desired (i.e. the controller's commands always
take precedence).

Employing a golem in combat is tricky, for once one
attacks an opponent there is a cumulative 1% chance
each round (so 1% the first round, 2% the second, 3%
the third, and so on) that the golem will stop following
commands and become berserk. Once this happens
the golem will attack any creature in range, choosing
targets randomly when there are more than one. If all
targets are killed or driven away the golem will move
on, looking for more creatures to kill and breaking
down any barrier that stands in its way if it is at all
possible.

The berserk chance for a golem that is still under
control is reset to 0% only when the golem is inactive,
neither attacking nor being attacked, for one full round.

The creator of the golem (but not any other person
who might have been delegated control) may try to
calm the golem, speaking firmly to it to convince it to
stop. The creator needs to succeed at a saving throw
vs. Spells to do this, after spending a round talking to
the golem. If this roll fails the golem turns its attention
to the creator and pursues them with single-minded
hatred.

If a berserk golem is unable to attack anyone for 5
rounds it resumes its inactive state, and the controller
can again give it commands. If it begins to pursue its
creator, though, it will never stop no matter how long it
takes, and must normally be trapped or destroyed to
stop it. It has no special way to find the creator,
however, and will become inactive if it loses sight of the
creator for a minimum of 1 day. If the golem is
successfully calmed, it can be given commands again
on the very next round of combat.

As their bodies are made of non-living matter, golems
can only be hit by magical weapons. Conversely, they
are less resistant to various effects due to the fact that
they are not living creatures; in general, golems save as
if they were Fighters of ½ their hit dice in levels. For
example, a Bone Golem has 8 hit dice, but saves as a
Fighter of 4th level.

Amber golems are generally built to resemble lions or other great cats. They are able to detect invisible creatures or objects within 60', and can track with 95% accuracy through any terrain type.

style="position: absolute; top: 0.2in; left: 0in" A magical attack that deals electricity damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 full points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. For example, an amber golem hit by a **lightning bolt** for 20 points of damage is instead healed up to 6 points. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, the excess is ignored.

Bone golems are huge four-armed monsters created from the skeletons of at least two dead humanoids. Though made of bone, they are not undead and cannot be turned.

Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem can be armed with two two-handed weapons, giving 2 attacks per round and a damage figure of 1d10 or by weapon (each).

These golems resemble statues made of bronze; unlike natural bronze statues, they never turn green from verdigris. A bronze golem is 10 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. A bronze golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.

The interior of a bronze golem is molten metal. Creatures hit by one in combat suffer an additional 1d10 points of damage from the heat (unless resistant to heat or fire). If one is hit in combat, molten metal spurts out, spraying the attacker for 2d6 damage. A save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid the metal spray.

Clay golems are made of clay, naturally, and thus may
be any natural clay color; generally, one is will be
grayish in color, but common clay containing iron oxide
may be used which results in a red, brown, or even
orange clay golem. They are usually unclad, but some
golem-makers choose to put a leather belt, girdle, or
apron on their creation. A clay golem weighs about
600 pounds.

Wounds inflicted by a clay golem do not heal normally;
worse, magical healing cures only 1 point per die rolled
(but add all bonuses normally). Thus, a **cure light wounds** spell heals just 2 points.

Flesh golems are horrible creations made of body parts
from deceased humanoids (including all character races
as well as humanoid monsters), crudely stitched
together and animated by magic. A flesh golem is 8
feet tall and weighs about 450 pounds.

A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a
flesh golem (as the [slow](allSpells.qmd#haste) spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no
saving throw. Attacks using lightning or electricity heal
1 point of damage per every 3 points the attack would
normally inflict, rounded down; further, such an attack
breaks any ongoing slow effect on the golem. As usual,
healing will not increase the monster above its normal
hit points. For example, a flesh golem hit by a
[lightning bolt](allSpells.qmd#lightning-bolt) which should deal 14 points of damage
instead receives up to 4 points of healing.

Iron golems are huge, generally 11 to 12 feet in height with a weight of 4,500 to 5,500 pounds. Such golems are usually fashioned like statues, and may appear to be wearing armor and armed with a shortsword or mace; the sculpting will often be simpler and cruder than that done by a real sculptor. Though an iron golem has no voice, it is hardly silent when in motion, as its gentlest footstep on any hard surface shakes the floor and walls. Note that, while an iron golem has little if any odor normally, when wet they have a strong metallic smell detectable up to 60 feet away.

Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which fills a 10-foot cube and persists for 1 round. Those within the area of effect must save vs. Dragon Breath or die. This ability can be used up to 3 times per day.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as the [slow](allSpells.qmd#haste) spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw. Attacks using fire heal 1 point of damage per every 3 points the attack would normally inflict, rounded down; further, such an attack breaks any ongoing slow effect on the golem. As usual, healing will not increase the monster above its normal hit points. For example, an iron golem hit by a fireball which should deal 17 points of damage instead receives up to 5 points of healing. An iron golem is affected by rust attacks such as that of a rust monster, suffering 2d6 points of damage for each hit (with no saving throw normally allowed).

Stone golems are quite large, normally being about 8 to 10 feet in height with a weight of around 2,000 pounds. These golems are usually fashioned like statues, and may appear to be wearing armor and armed with a shortsword or mace; the sculpting will often be simpler and cruder than that done by a real sculptor.

Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful and difficult to harm. A stone golem can use a [slow](allSpells.qmd#haste) effect, as the spell, once every other round; a save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration of 2d6 rounds.

A [stone to flesh](allSpells.qmd#flesh-to-stone) spell may be used to weaken the monster. The spell does not actually change the golem's structure, but for one full round after being affected, the golem is vulnerable to normal weapons. The stone golem is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist this effect.

Wood golems are small constructs, not more than 4' in height, and are crudely made. Being made of wood makes them vulnerable to fire-based attacks; thus, wood golems suffer one extra point of damage per die from fire; any saving throws against such effects are at a penalty of -2. They move stiffly, suffering a -1 penalty to Initiative.

Gorgons are magical monsters resembling cattle made
of iron. Their breath can turn living creatures to stone;
it covers an area 60' long by 10' wide, and can be used
as many times per day as the monster has hit dice, but
no more often than every other round. A save vs.
Petrify is allowed to resist.

An adult male gorgon weights up to 4,500 pounds and
can be as much as 7 feet tall at the shoulder and up to
9 feet long. Females (cows) will be a bit smaller,
perhaps no more than 6 feet at the shoulder and 8 feet
long with a weight of around 4,000 pounds. However,
their combat statistics are much the same as the males.
Any group of more than one gorgon will consist of one
bull with the rest being cows

Griffons are large carnivorous creatures resembling lions with the head, foreclaws and wings of eagles. From nose to tail, an adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad, golden wings emerge from the creature's back and span 25 feet or more. An adult griffon weighs about 500 pounds.

Griffons nest on high mountaintops, soaring down to feed on horses, the beast's preferred prey. They hunt and travel in ocks. A Griffon will attack a horse over anything else, diving low to swipe with their claws. They are not above retreating and coming back later, when there may be less of a defense mounted.

Griffons can be trained as mounts if raised in captivity, but even in this case they may try to attack horses if any come within about 120'. Roll a morale check in this case; if the check is failed, the griffon will try to attack immediately. A light load for a griffon is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Hangman trees are horrible, semi-animate creatures that fertilize themselves with dead bodies. A hangman tree has four animated limbs that can wrap around the necks of living creatures that pass beneath, strangling for 1d6 points of damage per round. These limbs are arranged evenly around the tree in most cases, and generally no more than one limb can attack any single creature at a time.

The roots of this tree are also animated; they do not attack, but they do pull dead bodies below the surface of the ground for "digestion."

A harpy looks like a giant vulture bearing the torso and face of a human female. They are able to attack with their claws as well as with a normal weapon, but they are most feared for the power of their song by which they are able to charm living creatures, and, having charmed them, tear them to pieces at their leisure.

All living creatures within a 300' range of one or more singing harpies must make a save vs. Spells or become **charmed**. The same harpy’s song cannot affect a creature that successfully saves again for 24 hours. This charm is very powerful, such that a victim will approach the harpy or harpies without fear with a dazed expression on its face. If the victim is led toward some danger, such as a ravine, fire, or the like, a second saving throw is allowed immediately; however, if this save fails the victim will proceed directly into danger.

Once in reach of a harpy, a charmed victim will surrender completely, even allowing the harpy to attack and kill it without putting up any sort of resistance. The charm effect lasts one full round after all harpies have ceased singing.

Normal hawks (or falcons) are raptors, predatory birds
that typically subsist on small snakes and other vermin.
Most have wingspans of less than 5 feet and a body
length of no more than 2 feet.

Giant hawks are 4 to 6 feet long, with wingspans of 12
feet or more; they can carry off creatures of Halfling size
or smaller.

All hawks will shy away from combat with any creature
of equal or greater size, unless forced or cornered or
their eggs or offspring are threatened.

Hellhounds are large canine creatures sheathed in hellish flame; they range in size from 3 to 5 feet at the shoulder (3 feet for a 3 hit die monster, plus ½ foot for each additional hit die) with a weight ranging from 100 to 200 pounds (100 pounds at 3 hit dice plus 25 pounds per additional hit die). These monsters are native to another plane where they hunt in packs; sometimes powerful wizards or evil priests summon them for use as watchdogs. In addition to biting, each hellhound may breathe fire a number of times per day equal to its hit dice. In combat, one-third of the time (1-2 on 1d6) a hellhound will choose to breathe fire; otherwise it will attempt to bite. Roll each round to determine which attack form will be used.

A hellhound's breath weapon is a cone of flame 10' wide at the far end which is 10' long for those with 3 or 4 hit dice, 20' long for those with 5 or 6 hit dice, and 30' long for the largest hellhounds. This breath weapon does 1d6 points of damage per each hit die of the hellhound to all within the area of effect; a successful saving throw vs. Dragon Breath reduces damage to half normal.

Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice each has. If generating a group randomly, roll 1d6+1 for the hit dice of each, reading a total of 2 as 3. A hellhound has an Armor Class equal to 11 plus its hit dice.

Hippogriffs resemble large fying horses with the forefront of a bird of prey. A typical hippogriff is 9 feet long, has a wingspan of 20 feet, and weighs 1,000 pounds.

A hippogriff avoids the territories and civilizations of other creatures, dwelling in extreme altitudes. **Griffons** sometimes prey upon them, and hippogriffs will generally attack griffons on sight if they have a numerical advantage.

Hippogriffs are omnivorous, entering combat only as defense, save for those times a griffon is met. They are prized as flying mounts since, unlike griffons, they are relatively safe around horses; note that it is still necessary to raise one in captivity in order to use it as a mount. A light load for a hippogriff is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Hobgoblins are, basically, man-sized goblins. They are better organized than their smaller kin, and are also better adapted to life in the sun. Their skin tone ranges from a greenish tan to a grayish brown, and their hair and eyes are usually dark. Most wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields for armor. As with most goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.

Tribes of hobgoblins prefer to live in walled villages, or preferably in castles, and are quite willing to overrun villages or castles built by other races rather than build their own. Some tribes do choose to live underground. Hobgoblins have a well-known hatred of elves, and will attack them whenever they think they can win.

One out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Regular hobgoblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20', having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or more there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with a shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11) having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular hobgoblin, but has Magic-User abilities of level 1d6.

Hydras are reptilian creatures with multiple heads. They are bad-tempered and territorial, but not particularly cunning.

The Armor Class and Hit Dice of a hydra are keyed to the number of heads; specifically, a hydra has a number of Hit Dice exactly equal to the number of heads, and an Armor Class equal to the number of heads plus 11. Note that these statistics do not change if an individual loses heads, as described below.

A hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however, most who fight them choose to strike at their heads. If a character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a particular head (i.e. states such intent to the GM) and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be able to attack anymore. Such damage also applies to the monster's total hit points, of course.

Some hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a swimming rate rather than walking in this case. A very few hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit a flame 10' wide and 20' long one time per head per day. This attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it is available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs. Dragon Breath reducing the amount by half. Note that the XP value of a fire-breathing hydra should be higher; treat them as if they have a single asterisk (i.e. add the special ability bonus to the base XP for the monster).

Hyenas are doglike carnivores who exhibit some of the behaviors of canines but are not related. They not only hunt but also scavenge and steal meals. A hungry hyena will chew on anything that is even remotely tainted by blood, meat or other food traces. They will mostly be found in the same savanna-like environments where lions and zebras may be found. They can live in clans of up to a hundred individuals, though smaller groups are more common. They are among the favorite pets of gnolls, who may take them into regions where they are not normally found.

Hyenodon refers to ancient four-legged predators whose name means "hyena tooth." While they are not technically hyenas, the statistics given may be used for the giant prehistoric hyena varieties as well; likewise, some varieties of hyenodon were smaller, and the statistics for standard hyenas may be used for them.

An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit. In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to three 10' cubes, though it is possible for a swarm to become more compact in order to move through a small doorway or narrow corridor. If the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10' squares and the flying movement above is ignored.

Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm suffers 1d3 points of damage each round. Damage rolls are doubled if the victim is unarmored (for creatures which do not wear armor, any creature having less than Armor Class 15 is considered unarmored).

Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds if the character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to "ward off" the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in this case also damage is reduced to 1 point per round. If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round. Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be affected by a **sleep** spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from the victim(s) due to smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more round.

Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon them to perform specific tasks.

A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until the task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert its instructions accordingly.

Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A [detect invisible](allSpells.qmd#detect-invisible) spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud. Don't forget to apply the standard penalty of -4 on the attack die when an invisible stalker is attacked by a creature which is unable to see it.

| XP:             | 175        |

An ironbane resembles a large armadillo in its overall
body plan, but has an anteater-like snout with a long
flicking tongue, and long, strangely hare-like back legs
which allow it to hop from place to place. When
attacking or pursuing, the ironbane stands up on its
hind legs, but when resting or moving slowly it folds
them and walks on all four feet.

Like the more common rust monster, the touch of any part of an ironbane's body
transforms metal objects into rust (or verdigris, or other
oxides as appropriate). Non-magical metal attacked by
an ironbane, or that touches the monster (such as a
sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A non-
magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does
half damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons
or armor lose one "plus" each time they make contact
with the ironbane; this loss is permanent.

The metal oxides created by this monster are its food;
thus, a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path
may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored
characters. Use a morale check to determine this.

Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of
no interest to an ironbane and will be ignored. Silver
and copper on the other hand are candy for this
creature and one will pursue the tastiest-smelling
adventurer in any party.

These great cats are about 8 to 9 feet long (from nose to tail-tip) and weigh about 165 pounds. Unlike other great cats, they enjoy swimming and often hunt near rivers or lakes. Jaguars kill with their powerful bite, preferring to deliver a fatal wound to the skull of their prey.

## Jelly

Jellies are strange creatures made of amorphous
protoplasm. They are similar to tiny single-celled
creatures such as a few wizards may have studied using
magic, but far larger. Jellies are always completely non-
intelligent, and are thus immune to **sleep** or **charm**
magic as well as any form or **mind reading** or
telepathy. Generally they also do not check morale,
but simply move toward any potential meal and attack
automatically.

Black jellies are amorphous creatures that live only to
eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the
world, scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search
of organic matter, living or dead. They attack any
creatures they encounter, lashing out with pseudopods
or simply engulfing opponents with their bodies, which
secrete acids that help them catch and digest their prey.

If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with
lightning or electricity, a black jelly suffers no injury, but
will be split into two jellies; the GM should divide the
original creature's hit dice between the two however
they see fit, with the limitation that neither pudding may
have less than two hit dice. A two hit die black jelly is
simply unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split
further.

Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black jelly, but
such an attack will paralyze the jelly for one round per
die of damage the attack would normally cause. Other
attack forms will affect a black jelly normally; the
preferred method of killing one usually involves fire.

The typical black jelly measures 10 feet across and 2
feet thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black
jellies of smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly as
a result of the splitting described above.

The glass jelly travels slowly along dungeon corridors
and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash.
Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside
the jelly’s body. Glass jellies are huge, averaging 1,000
cubic feet and weighing as much as 20,000 pounds.
The body of a glass jelly is more viscous than that of
other jellies, and it tends to take on the shape of its
surroundings such that one in a dungeon with 10' wide
corridors might have a shape similar to that of a cube,
while one living in round sewer drains under a city
would have a cylindrical or half-cylindrical shape.

If a glass jelly encounters a narrow place (a doorway,
for example) it will need 2d4 rounds to push through
the constriction and will have assumed a new shape
after doing so; such a new shape will persist for twice as
long as it took to pass the constriction before the
monster begins to flow into a shape that fills the
available space again.

Glass jellies move quietly, making a faint sucking or
slurping sound if anyone thinks to listen. Combined
with their transparency, they are able to surprise prey
on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6. Worse, any living creature hit
by a glass jelly must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed
for 2d4 turns in addition to suffering damage from its
acid secretions.

Any treasure indicated will be visible inside the creature,
which must be slain if the treasure is to be recovered.

Gray jellies are amorphous creatures that live only to
eat. They inhabit underground areas, scouring caverns,
ruins, and dungeons in search of organic matter, living
or dead. Average individuals will be up to 10 feet in
diameter, about 6 inches thick (high), and weigh up to
2,500 pounds.

The acid secretions of the gray jelly can dissolve most
organic matter and most metals; stone and glass are not
affected, however. After a successful hit, the jelly will
stick to the creature attacked, dealing 2d8 damage per
round automatically. Normal (non-magical) armor or
clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately.
Any non-magical weapon made of metal or wood
which hits a gray jelly will be similarly destroyed.
Magical weapons, armor, and clothing are allowed a
saving throw (use the wearer's save vs. Death Ray,
adding any magical "plus" value to the roll if applicable).

Green jelly devours flesh and organic materials on
contact and is even capable of dissolving metal given
enough time. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to
walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it
consumes organic matter. It drops from walls and
ceilings when it detects movement (and possible food)
below. Green jelly cannot grow in sunlight; even the
indirect sunlight of a dense forest will stunt it and
prevent it from spreading, and direct sunlight will kill it
outright within a turn.

On the first round of contact, the jelly can be scraped
off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping
device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut
away (dealing the same damage to both the victim and
the jelly). A cure disease spell will destroy a patch of
green jelly. It does not harm stone or enchanted metal,
but can dissolve normal metal or enchanted wood in a
turn and normal wood in 2d4 rounds.

If not destroyed or scraped off within 6+1d4 rounds,
the victim will be completely transformed into more
green jelly; such a character or creature cannot be
retrieved by any magic short of a wish.

Ochre jellies are yellowish-brown amorphous monsters.
Average individuals will be up to 10 feet in diameter,
about 6 inches thick (high), and weigh up to 2,500
pounds.

Ochre jellies can only be hit (damaged) by fire or cold.
Attacks with weapons or electricity/lightning cause the
creature to divide into 1d4+1 smaller jellies of 2 hit dice
apiece. If divided, the resulting smaller jellies do 1d6
points of damage with each hit. Other attack forms
simply have no effect on the monster.

Kobolds are diminutive, dog-faced humanoids with reptilian skin. They stand between 2½ and 3½ feet tall and typically weigh around 40 pounds. They are cowardly by nature, and in combat they prefer ambushing their foes and constructing traps both clever and deadly; to simply stand and fight is considered the worst possible strategy, and kobolds may fake withdrawing in fear in order to draw enemies into a trap.

Kobolds prefer to rely on ranged combat whenever possible. They tend to favor daggers and short spears since both can be used in close quarters or thrown at foes at range. Some may be armed with diminutive bows or crossbows which inflict 1d4 points of damage on a hit.

Kobolds normally dwell underground, while those who choose to dwell above ground may adopt a nocturnal lifestyle. All possess Darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and generally avoid exposure to daylight. When they are exposed to sunlight or the effect of **continual light** they suffer a penalty of -1 to all attack rolls. Most kobolds wear leather armor in combat.

One out of every six kobolds in any group is a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve is a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) with an armor class of 14 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who wears chain mail with an armor class of 15 (11) and has a movement rate of 10' and a +1 bonus to damage. In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior kobold statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the shaman as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its clerical level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.

Kobolds are sometimes confused with barklings, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a kobold a barkling or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult.

Giant leeches are slimy, segmented wormlike creatures which live in water. Salt or fresh, clean or stagnant, there are giant leech varieties for all wet environments. However, only a true leech expert can tell the various types apart. An average giant leech will be 4 to 6 feet long.

Once a giant leech hits in combat, it attaches to the victim and sucks blood, causing an additional 1d6 points of damage each round until the victim or the leech is dead. There is no way to remove the leech other than to kill it.

Leopards are large cats that are 7 to 8 feet long
including tail, and weigh about 175 lb. These cats have
four black spots that form a large circle (rosette). The
center of the circle and around the rosette spots range
from yellow tan to white on the underside. An all-black
leopard is called a Panther. The tail has a white tip.
They don’t like to swim as much as jaguars, preferring
instead to climb trees. A leopard will drag prey into a
tree.

The lion is a large cat found in grasslands and
savannas. They have muscular, broad-chested bodies,
short, rounded heads, round ears, and a hairy tuft at
the end of its tail. Adult male lions are larger than
females, and in most varieties have a prominent mane.
They live in social groups called prides consisting of a
few adult males, several related females, and their cubs.

Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying
mostly on large ungulates; any hunting group of 1 or 2
is 80% likely to be females, and any group of 3 or more
almost certainly are. Sometimes male lions are rogues,
living outside a pride, and in those cases they may hunt
as individuals or in pairs.

Lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on
humans. Injured or obviously vulnerable humans may
be too much of a temptation though.

## Living Statue

Living statues are magically animated. They are true automatons, unlike golems, which are animated by elemental spirits. While this means that living statues have no chance of going "berserk," it also means that they may only perform simple programmed activities. They may not be commanded in any meaningful fashion. They make very effective guards for tombs, treasure rooms, and similar places.

Living statues can be crafted to resemble any sort of living creature, but most commonly are made to look like humans or demi-humans.

Giant gecko lizards range from 4' to 6' in length, and are generally green in color, though grey or white versions can be found underground. They can climb walls and even walk across ceilings at full movement rate due to their specialized toe pads. They are carnivores, typically attacking weaker prey from above.

Giant horned chameleons average 8' to 10' in length. They are typically green, but can change color to blend into their surroundings, allowing them to surprise prey on 1-4 on 1d6. Giant horned chameleon have very long tongues, able to spring out up to 20' forward; the sticky muscular ball on the end grabs on to the chameleon's prey, and the chameleon then drags the prey to its mouth, doing bite damage automatically on the following round (and all subsequent rounds, until the chameleon is killed or fails a morale check, or until the prey is dead).

The horns of the giant horned chameleon are used only in mating rituals, not in combat.

Giant tuataras are large, being 10' to 12' long, and heavily built. They are predators with a powerful shearing bite. Giant tuataras are more resistant to cold than most lizards, and are thus sometimes found hunting deep underground. They are also known to hibernate in cold weather.

Monitor lizards are generally dark in color, but often
have bright, colorful, lace-like patterns covering their
skin. A monitor may rise up onto its hind legs to run at
a rate of 60 feet per round; such movement must be in
a straight line, ending with the creature on all fours
again. However, unlike a "double move" running
movement, the monitor may still attack after moving. 

Large monitor lizards range from 4 to 7 feet in length,
and include such creatures as the so-called Komodo
Dragon. Their venom is slow; those who are bitten
must save vs. Poison at +2, with failure resulting in the
victim suffering 1d6 points of damage each turn for 2d4
turns.

Huge monitors range from 8 to 11 feet in length. Their
venom works faster than that of their smaller brethren;
those bitten must save vs. Poison at +2 or suffer 1d6
points of damage each round for 2d4 rounds.

Giant monitor lizards range from 12 to 15 feet in length.
Those bitten by a giant monitor must save vs. Poison at
+2 or die.

All monitors are carnivores who hunt by running down
their prey, and anything smaller than a monitor is
considered prey.

**Common lizard men** are tall, generally 6 to 7 feet tall
at adulthood and weighing up to 250 pounds. Males
and females are basically the same size, and it is quite
difficult for other races to tell them apart. Due to their
great Strength they always receive a +1 to damage
done with melee weapons. They wear leather armor
and carry shields in battle.

Lizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their
breath for an extended period of time (up to a full turn).
They cannot swim while wearing armor; however, they
often hide in the water even while armored, standing
on the bottom with just nose and eyes exposed (similar
to a crocodile). When they are able to employ this
maneuver, lizard men surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.

Lizard men are largely indifferent to other races, being
primarily interested in their own survival. If aroused,
however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple but
sound tactics.

**Subterranean lizard men**, also called troglodytes, are
superficially very similar to the common variety. Their
skin is paler, and their eyes are red and seem to glow in
low light conditions. Individuals are shorter than the
common variety, standing just 5 to 6 feet tall, due in
part to their somewhat "hunched" stance. They weigh
about as much as the common type.

These monsters can change color at will, allowing them
to blend into underground environments so well that
they gain surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6.
Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any
surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills.

Subterranean lizard men secrete a smelly oil that keeps
their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of
course, all the standard character races) find the scent
repulsive, and those within 10 feet of one must make a
saving throw versus poison. Those failing the save
suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain
within 10 feet of the creature. Getting out of range
negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates
the penalty without an additional saving throw. The
results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after
which a new save must be rolled.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Lycanthrope*" >

## Lycanthrope*

Lycanthropes are humans who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other human, though those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.

Lycanthropy is spread like a disease. Any human who loses half or more of his or her hit points due to lycanthrope bite and/or claw attacks will subsequently contract the same form of lycanthropy in 3d6 days. For demi-humans and humanoids, contracting the disease is fatal in the same time period. A **cure disease** cast before the onset is complete will stop the progress of the disease, but once the time has elapsed, the transformation is permanent.

When first infected, most lycanthropes cannot control
their changes and will transform when stressed or under
some other type-specific circumstances. After around
two to three years, they gain the ability to change at
will, and may attempt to resist involuntary
transformation by means of a saving throw vs.
Paralysis.

In animal form, lycanthropes may be hit only by silver or magical weapons.

Werebears are humans that can transform into large bears. When in human form, they typically appear as well-muscled, imposing figures, with an abundance of thick hair. Werebears typically dwell in deep forests, far from civilization. They are distrustful of those that they do not know, but will ferociously defend those that they have befriended.

Wereboars gain full control of their transformations
quickly, needing only about a year to achieve mastery.
They have just two forms, that of a human and that of a
particularly large wild boar or sow.

In human form they tend to have "piggish" features
such as gluttony and cunning, as well as an often strong
physical resemblance to swine. Wereboars usually
dislike both hard work and responsibility, but they are
bullies who enjoy being in charge. They are easily
bored with mundane things but are excited by violence
(whether witnessing it or participating in it).

In addition to assuming the form of a giant rat, wererats can assume a hybrid form. This ratman form shares the animal form's immunity to normal weapons and can deliver an identical bite, but in this form the wererat may use a normal weapon instead of biting. Note that the wererat in ratman form cannot bite and use a weapon in the same round.

In human form, wererats tend to be skinny, nervous-looking individuals with pointed noses and lank hair. Their hair is almost always a rat-like brown color; those with different hair color who become wererats usually undergo a slow change to this color.

Unlike most lycanthropes, wererats prefer to inhabit civilized areas, particularly cities. They frequently lair in sewers or other underground areas, coming out by night to steal from or kill city folk. The common stereotype of wererats as thieves is not unfounded; in fact, in many cities wererats lead the guild of thieves, sometimes secretly, sometimes not so much.

Weretigers are humans that can transform into tigers. In human form, they tend to be tall, trim, and very agile. They tend to live and hunt close to human settlements, and are excellent trackers (5 in 6 chance to track prey in either form). Weretigers will typically only attack if provoked. They are capricious and arbitrary to
deal with unless whatever offer is made to them is very attractive to them.

Werewolves may be found anywhere humans are
found. They are ferocious predators, equally willing to
eat animal or human flesh. Unlike most lycanthropes,
werewolves have no distinguishing features in human
form, making them very hard indeed to identify.

Though they usually have only the usual human and
animal forms, there are rumors of some who are also
able to assume a wolfman form. In this form they may
choose to either bite or use a weapon, and may change
back and forth each round. As with the animal form,
the wolfman form is hit only by silver or magical
weapons.

Manticores look like an overgrown lion with thick leathery wings and an ugly bearded humanoid face, often like that of a human or dwarf. Their tail ends in an assortment of spikes, which the beast may fire as projectiles; a maximum of 24 are available, and the manticore will launch a random number (1d8, as shown above) each time it chooses to use this attack. The creature will regrow just 1d6 spikes per day after expending them, so they will often delay using them against weaker opponents who they think they can easily dispatch.

An adult manticore is big, with an average weight of 1,000 pounds and a length (not including tail) of around 8 feet.

Manticores are vicious carnivores with a preference for human flesh. They will use their ranged attacks to "soften up" larger or more dangerous-looking prey before closing to melee range.

**Mammoths** are huge, shaggy prehistoric relatives of
the elephant. Though found in a variety of climates,
they are most common in colder territories.

Like elephants, mammoths have five distinct attack
modes (two tusks, a trunk grab, and two tramples with
the front feet), but a single individual can apply no
more than two of these attacks to any single opponent
of small or medium size; large opponents may be
targeted by three of these attacks in a round. However,
one can attack multiple opponents in its immediate area
at the same time.

A light load for a mammoth is 8,500 pounds; a heavy
load, up to 17,000 pounds.

A mammoth has no treasure as such, but its tusks are
worth 2d6 x 100 gp.

**Mastodons** are a related species found in more
temperate climates. These prehistoric relatives of the
elephant are intelligent and able to communicate with
each other in a rudimentary way. They are more
aggressive than the common elephant and will attack
any creature they see as a threat.

They have the same basic attack modes as mammoths,
with the same limitations as given above.

A light load for a mastodon is 8,000 pounds; a heavy
load, up to 16,000 pounds.

A mastodon has no treasure as such, but its tusks are
worth 1d10 x 100 gp.

A medusa appears to be a human female with vipers growing from her head instead of hair. The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it unless a save vs. Petrification is made. In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC. It is safe to view a medusa's reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrification itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.

Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs. Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).

A medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human.

Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain. They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can without being discovered.

Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of dolphins. Also called "sirens," mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or other men found near the sea. They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.

A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid's temperament.

Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.

Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.

Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a pod.

One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.

A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only in groups of 1 or 2.

Mermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some Clerical abilities.

Minotaurs are huge bull-headed humanoid monsters. A minotaur stands more than 7 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds. Most minotaurs are very aggressive, and fly into a murderous rage if provoked or hungry. Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. They never become lost, and can track enemies with 85% accuracy. They gain +2 to damage when using melee weapons due to their great Strength. Minotaurs often wear toughened hides for armor.

Mummies are **undead** monsters, linen-wrapped preserved corpses animated through the auspices of dark desert gods best forgotten. Most mummies are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.

As they are undead, mummies are immune to **sleep**, **charm** and **hold** magic. They can only be injured by spells, fire, or magical weapons; furthermore, magic weapons do only half damage, while any sort of fire-based attack does double damage. Those injured by mummy attacks will contract **mummy rot**, a disease that prevents normal or magical healing; a **cure disease** spell must be applied to the victim before he or she may again regain hit points.

Nixies are small water fairies. As far as anyone knows, all nixies are female. Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. They often twine shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed. Nixies prefer not to leave their lakes. A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45 pounds.

Ten or more nixies can work together to cast a powerful charm (similar to **charm person**). The charm lasts one year (unless dispelled). A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. Each nixie can cast **water breathing** once per day, with a duration of one day. Finally, a group of nixies will often have a school of giant bass living nearby who can be called to their aid (see **Fish, Giant Bass** for details).

Nixies are fey creatures, and thus unpredictable. However, they are rarely malicious, attacking only when they feel threatened.

The giant octopus is, obviously, an enormous version of
the normal creature. They are physically powerful as
well as being clever, which makes them a serious threat
to seagoing vessels.

In order to bite a creature, the giant octopus must hit
with at least two tentacles first. Further, any time a
giant octopus hits with at least one tentacle per each
100 pounds of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it;
unless the victim can find a way to resist (using
whatever method the player might think of and
whatever rolls the GM may choose), they will be pulled
into the water and thus be in danger of drowning.

Don't forget to account for the weight of armor worn!
If a giant octopus fails a morale check, it will squirt out a
cloud of black "ink" 40' in diameter and then jet away at
twice normal speed for 2d6 rounds. Any characters
being held will normally be released at this point.

Ogres appear as large, very ugly humans. Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing consists of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally repellent odor. Ogres are brutish and aggressive, but inherently lazy. They employ direct attacks in combat, typically using large clubs, axes, or pole arms, generally causing 2d6 damage. If normal weapons are employed, an ogre has a +3 bonus to damage due to strength. If an ogre fights bare-handed, it does 1d8 subduing damage per hit.

One out of every six ogres will be a pack leader of 6+1 Hit Dice (500 XP). Ogres gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a pack leader. In ogre lairs of 10 or greater, there will also be an ogre bully of 8+2 Hit Dice (875 XP), with an Armor Class of 17 (13) (movement 20') and having a +4 bonus to damage due to strength. Ogre bullies generally wire together pieces of chainmail to wear over their hides. Ogres gain +2 to morale so long as the ogre bully is present (and alive).

Orcs are short humanoids (around 5' tall) with solidly-built bodies. Their upturned noses, wide pointed ears, and beady eyes give their faces a piglike appearance. An adult weighs about 200 pounds, and this weight does not differ much between males and females. Orcs utilize all manner of weapons and armor scavenged from battlefields.

Orcs have Darkvision to a range of 60'. They suffer a -1 attack penalty in bright sunlight or within the radius of a spell causing magical **light**. They speak their own rough and simple language, but many also speak some common or goblin.

One out of every eight orcs will be a warrior of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP). Orcs gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In orc lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11), a movement 20', and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or more, there will be an orc king of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with an Armor Class of 16 (11), in chainmail with a shield, movement 20', and having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, orcs never fail a morale check as long as the orc king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present. A shaman is equivalent to a warrior orc statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

Owls are birds of prey with large eyes and the ability to
fly without making a sound. They are nocturnal, and
have superior Darkvision of 120' range. An owl will
stand about 6 to 18 inches tall with a wingspan of 20
inches. An owl’s vision is very sharp and comparable
to that of a falcon. It can also hear very well, even to
the point that a rodent creeping through grass will draw
attention. The owl will fly over a field and listen and
watch for movement and then dive for a kill with its
talons.

Owlbear are among the most feared of the nocturnal
forest dwelling monsters, and for good reason for they
are always hungry and always aggressive. They appear
to be bears with owlish faces, including a large, sharp
beak. They fight much as do bears, and as with normal
bears an owlbear must hit with both claws in order to
do the listed "hug" damage.

These monsters are known to hunt by day when
particularly hungry, but they prefer to live nocturnally.
They have superior Darkvision with a range of 120 feet,
without the usual penalties for being in full sunlight.
They are also very quiet, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 in
their native territory.

These are decorative birds about the size of a falcon,
known for their ability to learn to mimic speech and
other sounds. Parrots usually have green or blue

to imitate human speech when raised in captivity, most

The pegasus is the winged horse of legend. They are
prized as aerial steeds as they are the swiftest of fliers,
but they are shy creatures who live in the highest
mountains, making them rare indeed in captivity.

An average female pegasus stands 5 feet high at the
shoulder, weighs 1,200 pounds, and has a wingspan of
20 feet; males are somewhat larger, averaging 6 feet in
height and weighing 1,400 pounds, with a wingspan of
22 feet. A light load for a pegasus is up to 400 pounds;
a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Pixies are winged fairies often found in forested areas.
Like sprites, pixies love beauty. They dress in bright
colors and favor clothing with flourishes like feathered
caps, curly-tipped shoes, scarves, and so on. They are
quite small, just 2½ feet in height and weighing no more
than 30 pounds. Pixies can only fly for 3 turns
maximum before requiring rest of at least one turn,
during which time the pixie may walk at normal speed
but may not fly.

A pixie can become **invisible** at will, as many times per
day as it wishes, and can attack while remaining
invisible. Anyone attacking an invisible pixie does so
with an attack penalty of -4 unless the attacker can
somehow detect invisible creatures. Pixies may
ambush their foes while invisible; if they do so, they
surprise on 1-5 on 1d6.

Pixies are whimsical, enjoying nothing so much as a
good joke or prank, especially at the expense of a "big
person."

Purple worms are gigantic subterranean monsters; they are rarely found above ground. The body of a mature purple worm is 5-8 feet in diameter and 60-100 feet long, weighing about 40,000 pounds.

The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail; those injured by it must save vs. Poison or die. Note that the purple worm's movement is less than the monster's length, so that, if attacking from out of a tunnel, it might not be able to use the stinger for several rounds.

Any time a purple worm successfully bites a man-sized or smaller opponent with a natural roll of 19 or 20, the opponent has been swallowed, and will suffer 3d6 damage per round afterward due to being digested. A character who has been swallowed can only effectively attack with small cutting or stabbing weapons such as dagger or shortsword.

These omnivorous rodents thrive almost anywhere. Normal rats attack as a swarm; each point of damage done to the swarm reduces their numbers by one animal.

Giant rats are scavengers, but will attack to defend their nests and territories. A giant rat can grow to be up to 4 feet long and weigh over 50 pounds. A single giant rat, or a small group of up to four, will generally be shy, but larger packs attack fearlessly, biting and chewing with their sharp incisors.

Any rat bite has a 5% chance of causing a disease. A character who suffers one or more rat bites where the die roll indicates disease will sicken in 3d6 hours. The infected character will lose one point of Constitution per hour; after losing each point, the character is allowed a save vs. Death Ray (adjusted by the current Constitution bonus or penalty) to break the fever and end the disease. Any character reduced to zero Constitution is dead. See **Constitution Point Losses** in the **Encounter** section for details on regaining lost Constitution.

\* Note: The XP award for normal rats is for driving away or killing an entire pack of normal size. If the adventurers are forced to flee, the GM should award 3 XP per rat slain.

The rhagodessa is related to both spiders and
scorpions, though it is not properly either. Rhagodessas
have "pedipalps," an elongated pair of forelegs with
sticky pads on them for capturing prey.

Giant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found
in desert terrain are generally marked in yellow, red,
and brown, while those found underground may be
black or white in color (those found in the deepest
caverns are always white). Like spiders, they can climb
walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise
climb entirely upside down.

A hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck
fast and will be drawn to the rhagodessa's mouth on the
next round and automatically hit for 2d8 points of
damage; this repeats each round, so long as the victim
is held. Escaping from the sticky hold requires a
successful roll to open doors. If both legs hit, this roll
frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is
needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa
can simply attack again with the free leg on the next
round. Alternately, victims may attack with small or
medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2
is added to the attack roll if a small weapon is used. If
the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be
freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in
this case another character can help, making the roll for
the victim).

The rhagodessa seems unable to use its bite attack
against a foe it has not captured in this way, and neither
will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If
threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim
will attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace.

A rhinoceros (or "rhino") is a member of any of several species (including numerous supposedly extinct species) of odd-toed hooved mammals. They are found primarily in tropical and temperate grasslands.

The woolly rhinoceros is a prehistoric beast with long fur, found in primitive "lost world" areas in colder territories. They behave much as the black rhino does.

Rocs are birds similar to eagles, but even a "normal" roc
is huge, being about 9 feet long and having a wingspan
of 24 feet. Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have
wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet
long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A
roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head
to tail. Like most birds, the males have the brighter
plumage, with females being duller in color and thus
more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be
hidden, that is).

A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a
heavy load is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest
characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc. For a
large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy
load up to 1,200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3,000
pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to
6,000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off full-
grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note
that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for
these monstrous birds.

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to
snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for
itself and its young to devour. Any successful hit with
both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results
in that creature being carried off, unless of course the
creature is too large for the roc to carry. While being
carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to
be as "fresh" as possible when given to the hatchlings
(or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary).

When rocs are encountered they are almost certainly
hunting, and will generally attack creatures of horse size
or less. If facing a large group the rocs may make
passes close overhead to scatter them first before each
chooses a single target to prey upon. Mated pairs
found in their nests will fight to the death to protect
their eggs or offspring (morale of 12 in this case).

Rot grubs are 1-inch long vermin found in carrion, dung, and other such garbage and organic material. Their skin color is white or brown. When a living creature contacts an area (dung heap, offal, etc) infested with rot grubs, the grubs will attack if they can come in contact with the victim’s skin. A rot grub secretes an anesthetic when it bites and will burrow into the flesh. A burrowing grub can be noticed if the victim makes a successful save vs. Death Ray with Wisdom bonus applied in order to notice a strange rippling beneath their skin. Otherwise, the victim does not notice the grubs. During the first two rounds, a burrowing rot grub can be killed by applying fire to the infested skin or by cutting open the infested skin with any slashing weapon. Either method deals 1d8 points of damage to the victim, but kills the grubs. After the second round, only a **cure disease** can kill the grubs as they burrow to the victim's heart and devour it in 1d3 turns.

A rust monster (sometimes known as a corroder or
corrosion beast) is a strange monster built like a huge
turtle, with an insectoid head sporting large feather-like
antennae and a thick tail with a hammer-like protrusion
at the tip which seems to serve no purpose whatsoever.

The touch of any part of a rust monster's body oxidizes
metal objects instantly, turning them to rust, verdigris,
or other oxides as appropriate. One attacks with its
antennae, brushing them over metal items. Non-
magical metal attacked by a rust monster, or that
touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it),
is instantly ruined. A hit with a non-magical metal
weapon inflicts half damage before the weapon is
destroyed. Magic weapons or armor permanently lose
one "plus" each time they make contact with the
monster.

The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a
substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may
cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters.
Use a morale check to determine this. Metals that do
not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to
a rust monster and will be ignored. While rust monsters
will consume oxides of silver or copper, they have a
strong preference for ferrous metals (iron or steel),
preferring them over any other metal.

Whether the rust monster is in any way related to the
rarer ironbane is unknown, but
both monsters seem to have the exact same power.

The sabre-tooth cat, or smilodon, is a prehistoric great
cat with very large canine teeth. They are more
robustly built than other great cats, with particularly
well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper
canine teeth. Sabre-tooth cats are ambush predators,
surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 in their natural environment
(forests and tall-grass prairies), where they prey
primarily upon large herbivores.

Flame salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of
Fire. They look like giant snakes, more than 12' long,
with dragon-like heads and lizard forelimbs. Their
scales are all the colors of flame, red and orange and
yellow. A flame salamander is flaming hot, and all non-
fire-resistant creatures within 20' of the monster suffer
1d8 points of damage per round from the heat. They
are immune to damage from any fire or heat attack.
Flame salamanders are intelligent; they speak the
language of the Plane of Fire, and many will also know
Elvish, Common, and/or Dragon.

Frost salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of
Water. They look like giant lizards with six legs. Their
scales are the colors of ice, white, pale gray and pale
blue. Frost salamanders are very cold, and all non-
cold-resistant creatures within 20' suffer 1d8 points of
damage per round from the cold. Frost salamanders
are completely immune to all types of cold-based
attacks. They are quite intelligent; all speak the
language of the Plane of Water, and many also speak
Common, Elvish, and/or Dragon.

Flame and frost salamanders hate each other, and each
type will attack the other on sight, in preference over
any other foe. If summoned by a Magic-User, a
salamander is often assigned to protect a location,
doorway, or treasure hoard; in such a case, the
salamander will attack anyone attempting to gain
unauthorized access to the protected area. Those
which arrive through natural rifts may have any goals or
motivations the GM wishes, and thus may choose to
parley, fight, or even ignore adventurers.

Lightning Salamanders come from the Elemental Plane
of Air. A lightning salamander resembles a giant snake
more than 12 feet long with two dragon-like heads (on
short but flexible necks). Its scales are all the colors of
lightning: white, blue, purple, and yellow. A lightning
salamander constantly emits little bolts of lightning; all
creatures within 20 feet of the salamander that are not
lightning-resistant suffer 1d8 points of damage per
round. A lightning salamander is immune to damage
from any type of electrical or lightning attack. It is
intelligent and can speak the language of the Plane of
Air, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or
Dragon.

Despite having two heads a lightning salamander has
only one mind; either head may speak or both may,
but it is very rare to meet a lightning salamander who
can speak different words with each head at the same
time (although those who can are known to sing duets
with themselves, which may give away one's location to
those listening).

Sand salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of
Earth. A sand salamander resembles a giant sea turtle
with six flippers and a serpentine neck and head, with
scales of varying shades of gray or brown.

The sand salamander's most feared attack is its bite, for
any living creature bitten by one must save vs. Petrify
or be turned to stone. In addition to attacking, a sand
salamander can temporarily transform any stone within
a 20 foot radius into sand. Characters in the affected
area must save vs. Paralysis each round in order to
move through the sand, and if the save is successful,
the character is still reduced to half their normal
movement. Whenever the sand salamander moves out
of range, the sand "congeals" back into stone, and any
character in the affected area must save vs. Paralysis or
become trapped. Extraction of a trapped person may
take quite a long time, chipping and hammering at the
stone to break it apart.

A sand salamander is immune to piercing attacks (such
as spears or arrows) and suffers half damage from
cutting attacks. It is intelligent and can speak the
language of the Plane of Earth; many may also know
Elvish, Common, or Dragon.

Giant scorpions are quite large, sometimes as large as a donkey. They are aggressive predators and generally attack on sight. If a claw attack hits, the giant scorpion receives a +2 attack bonus with its stinger (but two claw hits do not give a double bonus). Those hit by the stinger must save vs. Poison or die. Giant scorpions are most commonly found in desert areas or caverns.

Sea serpents are, obviously, serpentine monsters which live in the sea. They range from 20' to 40' long. A sea serpent can choose to wrap around a ship and constrict; in this case, roll 2d10 for damage to the vehicle, and reduce any effective Hardness by half.

A shadow is an incorporeal monster, literally a kind of living shadow. Only magical weapons will harm one. They have a generally humanoid shape and are around 5 to 6 feet in height, so that at a glance one might appear to be an actual shadow. Indeed, it's hard to see one after nightfall, or in poorly-lit or unlit spaces indoors or underground; on the other hand, they are plainly visible in daylight or in well-lit places.

Despite their appearance they are not **undead** monsters and thus do not share those creatures' weaknesses or powers; however, they are immune to **charm** and **sleep** magics

A shadow's attack does 1d4 damage (from cold) and drains 1 point of Strength from the victim. Victims reduced to 2 or fewer points of Strength collapse and become unable to move; those reduced to 0 Strength die and rise as shadows a day later (at nightfall). Otherwise, Strength points lost to shadows are recovered at a rate of 1 point per turn.

Bull sharks are so named because of their stocky, broad
build. Male bull sharks can grow up to 7' long and
weigh around 200 pounds, while females have been
known to be up to 12' long, weighing up to 500
pounds. Bull sharks are able to tolerate fresh water,
and often travel up rivers in search of prey.

Great white sharks range from 12' to 15' in length on the average, though specimens ranging up to 30' in length have been reported. They are apex predators. Great white sharks have the ability to sense the electromagnetic fields of living creatures, allowing them to find prey even when light or water clarity are poor, and are able to smell blood at great distances.

Giant shrews resemble giant rats, but are larger, being
up to 6' long, and darker in color. They have a very
fast metabolic rate and must eat almost constantly.
Giant shrews are omnivorous, and aggressively defend
their nests and the immediate territory around them.

Giant shrews move so swiftly that they are able to bite
twice per round, and they may attack two different
adjacent opponents in this way.

A few giant shrew species (generally no more than 5%
of those encountered) are venomous. The bite of such
a giant shrew will kill the victim unless a save vs. Poison
is made. A victim bitten twice in a round need only
save once for that round, but of course will have to
save again in subsequent rounds if bitten again.

A shrieker, sometimes called a wailing morel, is a large
(3' to 5' tall and about the same size across), semi-
mobile fungus that wails loudly as a defense mechanism
when approached or threatened. Shriekers are found
in underground areas such as caverns and dungeons.
They are found in a variety of pale colors, most
commonly white, gray, lavender, or red.

This monster does not attack directly; rather, its
shrieking tends to attract the attention of other monsters
in the nearby area. Movement or light within 10 feet,
or causing any damage to one, will cause one to wail
for 1d4 rounds.

In game terms, the GM should generally roll a
wandering monster check each round that this monster
wails.

Skeletons are mindless **undead** created by an evil Magic-User or Cleric, generally to guard a tomb or treasure hoard, or to act as guards for their creator. They take only ½ damage from edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). As with all undead, they can be **Turned** by a Cleric, and are immune to **sleep, charm** or **hold** magic. As they are mindless, no form of mind reading is of any use against them. Skeletons never fail morale, and thus always fight until destroyed.

Pit vipers are highly venomous snakes. There are many varieties ranging in size from 2' to 12' at adulthood; the statistics above are for an "average" variety which reaches about 9' in length.

Those bitten by a pit viper must save vs. Poison or die.

Pit vipers are named for the thermally sensitive "pits" between their eyes and nostrils. These are used to detect birds, mammals, and lizards, the natural prey of these snakes. Note that, even though lizards are cold-blooded, pit vipers can still sense them because their temperature will often be slightly higher or lower than their surroundings.

Rattlesnakes are a variety of pit viper; in addition to the details given above, a rattlesnake has a rattle (from which it gets its name) at the end of its tail. The rattle is used to warn away larger creatures.

After a successful bite attack, a python will wrap itself around the victim (in the same round), constricting for 2d4 damage plus an additional 2d4 per round thereafter. The hold may be broken on a roll of 1 on 1d6 (add the victim's Strength bonus to the range, so a Strength of 16 would result in a range of 1-3 on 1d6); breaking the hold takes a full round.

Sea snakes are relatively small; the largest varieties rarely exceed 6' in length. They have relatively small heads, and are very stealthy in the water. Their bite does so little damage that the creature bitten has only a 50% chance to notice the attack, but their poison is terribly strong, such that any creature bitten must save vs. Poison at a penalty of -4 or die.

Fortunately, sea snakes rarely attack; only if molested (grabbed, stepped on, etc.) will they do so. They are very clumsy when out of the water.

Spitting cobras average about 7' in length at adulthood. They use their spreading hood to warn other creatures not to bother them, and generally refrain from attacking if possible to allow larger creatures time to retreat. Failure to retreat from the spitting cobra will likely result in the cobra spitting venom; the cobra can project its venom up to 5', and any creature hit must roll a save vs. Poison or be blinded permanently (though the **cure blindness** spell can be used to heal this injury). If the cobra cannot deter a creature by spitting, it will attack using its bite. In this case, those successfully hit must save vs. Poison or die.

Spectres are incorporeal **undead** monsters. On any
successful hit against a living creature, a spectre drains
two life energy levels in addition to doing normal
damage. Any character slain by a spectre will arise at
the next sunset (but not sooner than 6 hours after
death) as a spectre under the control of its killer.

A spectre will normally resemble the living creature it
used to be. Most spectres are formed from humanoid
creatures, but some may have other forms and sizes;
statistically, most such creatures will be as given above,
but of course the GM may create special types.

Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to 
**sleep**, **charm** and **hold** magics. Due to their incorporeal nature, 
they cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

The giant black widow spider is a much enlarged version of the ordinary black widow; a full-grown male has a leg-span of 2 feet, while an adult female will be 3' or more across. Despite the size difference, both genders are statistically equal. Both genders are marked with an orange "hourglass" on the abdomen.

The venom of the giant black widow is strong, such that those bitten must save vs. Poison at a penalty of -2 or die. Giant black widow spiders spin strong, sticky, nearly invisible webs, usually across passageways or cave entrances, or sometimes between trees in the wilderness; those who stumble into these webs become stuck, and must roll to escape just as if opening a door. Any character stuck in such a web cannot effectively cast spells or use a weapon.

Crab spiders are ambush predators, hiding using various forms of camouflage and leaping out to bite their surprised prey. Giant crab spiders are horribly enlarged, being around 3' in length. They can change color slowly (over the course of a few days), taking on the overall coloration of their preferred lair or ambush location. After this change is complete, the spider is able to surprise potential prey on 1-4 on 1d6 when in that preferred location. Anyone bitten by a giant crab spider must save vs. Poison or die.

Giant tarantulas are huge, hairy spiders, about the size of a pony. They run down their prey much as wolves do. The bite of the giant tarantula is poisonous; those bitten must save vs. Poison or be forced to dance wildly. The dance lasts 2d10 rounds, during which time the victim has a -4 penalty on attack and saving throw rolls. If the victim is a Thief, he or she cannot use any Thief abilities while dancing. Onlookers must save vs. Spells or begin dancing themselves; such "secondary" victims suffer the same penalties as above, but they will only dance for 2d4 rounds.

Each round the original victim dances, he or she must save vs. Poison again or take 1d4 points of damage. Secondary victims do not suffer this effect.

**Neutralize poison** will cure the original victim, and **dispel magic** will stop the dance for all victims in the area of effect, whether they are original or secondary.

Sprites are reclusive fey creatures, looking like tiny elves just a foot tall with dragonfly-like wings. They go out of their way to fight evil and ugliness and to protect their homelands. Sprites fight their opponents with spell-like abilities and pint-sized weaponry. They prefer ambushes and other trickery over direct confrontation.

Five sprites acting together can cast **remove curse**, or its reversed form **bestow curse**, once per day. The latter spell is often used as an attack.

The giant squid dwells in the deep ocean. One can
grow to a tremendous size, to a maximum of around 40
feet for females and 33 feet for males. The mantle of
the giant squid is about 6½ feet long (more for females,
less for males). Their tentacles are studded with barbs
and sharp-edged suckers.

Members of any group of these creatures encountered
are equally likely to be male or female. The GM may
roll for this or may assign them as they see fit.

In order to bite a creature, the giant squid must hit with
at least two tentacles first. Further, any time a giant
squid hits with at least one tentacle per each 75 pounds
of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it; unless the victim
can find a way to resist (using whatever method the
player might think of and whatever rolls the GM may
choose), they will be pulled into the water and thus be
in danger of drowning. Don't forget to account for the
weight of armor worn!

If a giant squid fails a morale check, it will squirt out a
cloud of black "ink" 30' in diameter and then jet away at
twice normal speed for 3d8 rounds. If a group fails a
morale check they will move away in random directions
in hopes that at least one will escape any pursuit.

Stirges are weird winged creatures that some say may
have invaded from some other plane of existence.
They are relatively small, just about 1 foot long with a
wingspan of about 2 feet and an average weight of 1
pound. They vaguely resemble hairless bats with a
rubbery tubular proboscis and no back legs (so that
their body simply comes to a blunt point at the rear).

If a stirge hits a living creature, it grabs on with hooked
claws on its wing joints and quickly embeds its
proboscis in the victim's body. The proboscis has rows
of tiny serrated teeth on the inside, and literally turns
itself inside out as it carves a way into the victim's body.
This causes 1d4 points of damage, and the stirge then
proceeds to suck the victim's blood, inflicting an
additional 1d4 points of damage each round.

Once attached, the creature can only be removed by
killing it. The victim cannot use weapons larger than a
dagger or hand axe to attack the creature, and cannot
attack it at all if attacked from behind. Others may
attack the creature with a bonus of +2 on the die roll,
but any attack that misses hits the victim instead.

A strangle vine (sometimes called an assassin vine) is a
strange animated plant found in temperate and tropical
forests, particularly in areas with poor-quality soil. They
fertilize their soil by entangling, constricting, and killing
living creatures, then depositing the bodies in loose soil
around the plant's base.

Because it can lie very still indeed, a strangle vine
surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit
inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes
entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage
thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a
saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added;
this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this
and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to
crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the
victim manages to escape.

Strangle vines are actually mobile, able to uproot
themselves and move slowly from place to place; one
generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds.
They have no visual organs but can sense foes within
30 feet by sound and vibration.

Each plant consists of a single long vine of up to 20 feet
in length, with many smaller vines 5 feet or so in length
packed closely, two vines per foot or thereabouts. The
smaller vines are covered in leaves, and in the fall they
bear clusters of reddish-purple berries which are tough
and bitter but not poisonous.

There is a similar plant found in underground
environments which has leaves the color of iron with
pale shiny metallic veins. They grow near geothermal
vents or springs, and the rotting flesh that surrounds
them often supports mushrooms of various sizes and
types. This fungal growth conceals the strangle vine,
allowing it to surprise on 1-5 on 1d6 as does the above-
ground variety of the plant.

Tentacle worms appear to be giant worms of some sort, averaging 6 to 8 feet long. Their heads are pasty white or grey, but their bodies vary from livid pink or purple to deep green in color. Their tentacles splay out from around the creature's "neck." Some sages believe they are the larval form of some other monster, but this has never been proven.

A tentacle worm can attack as many as three adjacent opponents. Those hit must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed 2d4 turns. No matter how many of a tentacle worm's attacks hit an opponent in a given round, only one saving throw is required in each such round.

If all opponents of a tentacle worm are rendered paralyzed, it will begin to feed upon the paralyzed victims, doing 1 point of damage every 1d8 rounds until the victim is dead; if other paralyzed victims are still alive, the worm is 50% likely to move on immediately to another still-living victim. Otherwise, it continues to eat the corpse of the slain victim for 1d4 turns.

The tiger is among the largest great cat species, with
male specimens averaging 10 feet in length (including
about 2½ feet of tail) and weighing over 400 pounds.
Females are smaller, averaging about 8 feet long and an
average of about 275 pounds. Tigers are most
recognizable for their dark vertical stripes on orange fur
with a white underside.

Tigers are apex predators and prefer prey such as deer
and wild boar. They are territorial and generally
solitary but social predators, requiring large contiguous
areas of habitat to support their requirements for prey.

A titanothere is a huge prehistoric animal that resembles the rhinoceros; adults average 10' tall and 13' long. They have large, forked horns rather than the pointed horns of rhinos. Like rhinos, they are herd animals, and males aggressively defend the herd; females only enter combat if the male(s) are defeated or the attackers are very numerous. If a single titanothere is encountered, it will be a rogue male; they are bad tempered and prone to attacking smaller creatures that enter their territory.

Treants are a race of large, roughly humanoid tree-
people. When one stands still with its legs together it
cannot be easily distinguished from a normal oak tree.
Their leaves are nearly identical to oak leaves, and are
green in spring and summer, turning orange, red, or
yellow in the fall and winter. A treant's leaves do not
normally fall out in the winter, but as some oaks also
retain their leaves into cold weather this may not help in
identifying one.

Being actual trees, treants are big, averaging 25 to 35
feet in height and weighing 4,000 to 5,000 pounds.
Their language is difficult for most other races to learn,
though Elves are known to have an advantage in
mastering it. Many treants know Elvish, and some who
live near humans learn Common as well.

Treants are slow to act when potential enemies are
nearby, preferring watch them carefully before taking
any action. Because of their excellent camouflage
treants gain surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.

All treants have the power to animate other normal
trees in their area; up to two trees can be animated at
once, but the treant can release one and animate
another if needed. Trees to be animated must be
within 180 feet of the treant, and must remain within
that range or they will return to their normal state. An
animated tree requires a full round to uproot itself
before it can move around, and then can move at a
rate of just 10' per round. Of course, if enemies are
within reach the animated tree need not be uprooted.
If the treant controlling an animated tree is slain or
incapacitated, the tree returns to its normal state.

Any character or creature nearby when this happens
must save vs. Death Ray to scamper away; those who
fail will suffer 2d6 points of damage and will be trapped
under the fallen tree. The GM should consider
battlefield conditions when deciding on the exact results
of such an event.

Trolls are huge, rangy humanoids with lumpy skin that
is a dull grayish green in color. They stand up to 9 feet
tall despite having a rather hunched posture, and may
weigh as much as 600 pounds. Their skin is rubbery
and slightly damp to the touch, and they have long
sharp black claws and long sharp white teeth. Trolls
have a disconcerting tendency to smile toothily most of
the time, as if their brutal lives are the most entertaining
thing imaginable.

Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit
point of damage each round after being injured. A troll
reduced to 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled
for 2d6 rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point.
Note that the troll may "play dead" until it has
regenerated further. Damage from fire and acid cannot
be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a troll
can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower
morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll
faces attackers armed with fire or acid.

The regenerative power of trolls is so great that limbs or
other body parts (even a head!) can be reattached if
severed simply by pressing the severed ends back
together for a moment. Trolls in a group will generally
help dismembered fellows to reassemble themselves,
but only if it's convenient. If the severed part is not
restored, a new one will grow in its place in 1d4 turns.

Note that a troll with a new head will not remember its
former life, nor will it yet know how to speak; it will
behave as would any confused and hostile animal.

Trolls speak a primitive language, and are often fluent
in Goblin, Hobgoblin, Orc, Ogre, or Giant depending
on which of these species live nearest them. A few
(20% or so) speak Common.

Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and
bloodshed. Though trolls could easily use a variety of
weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being
rent by their teeth and claws.

A **trollwife** is a female troll; despite the name, there is
no requirement that she be married (nor, in fact, do
trolls normally engage in formal marriages). A typical
adult trollwife stands 11 feet tall and weighs 700
pounds. They have no outward appearance of
femininity, at least according to the standards of
humans, elves, or even orcs; rather, a trollwife simply
looks like an extraordinarily large troll. Like a normal
male troll, a trollwife has lumpy skin that is a dull
grayish green in color.

Trollwives have all the abilities and weaknesses of the
males of the species; in particular, they **regenerate**
exactly as do the males.

When encountered, a trollwife may be alone,
cohabitating with a male (her "husband"), or raising a
brood of trollkin. Roll 1d10; on a result of 1, she is
living alone; on a roll of 2-3, she is raising her young;
on 4 or higher, she is living with a male. If one has a
mate or offspring, there is a 1-3 on 1d10 chance she is
encountered alone, 4-7 that her mate or young are
encountered in her absence, or 8-10 that all are
present.

Add 1 to the trollwife's morale score if she is with her
mate, or 2 if she has young present. This means that,
unless threatened with fire or acid, a trollwife will fight
without checking morale while her offspring are
present. If a trollwife's mate or offspring are slain in her
absence, she will track the killers unerringly, and upon
finding them will attack with the same morale bonus.

Trollwives are solitary with respect to other adult
trollwives, for they hate each other with a fierce
passion. If forced together they will put aside their
enmity until all non-troll enemies are dead (at which
point they may well fight over who will eat the choicest
of the remains).

Trollkin are young trolls. They have all the powers and
weaknesses of trolls, and look exactly like smaller than
normal adult trolls. Even an infant has the same ability
to **regenerate** as an adult troll.

When you encounter trollkin, you can rest assured that
there is a trollwife nearby (unless, of course, you've
already slain her). They are as bloodthirsty as their
parents; as such, determining the number appearing is
done in a particularly unusual fashion:

Roll 1d6 for the number of individuals, and 2d6 for the
number of hit dice. Divide the number of hit dice by
the number of individuals to arrive at the hit dice of
each individual. Note that a trollkin won't be
encountered having more than 6 hit dice, so if only one
individual is indicated by the 1d6 roll but the 2d6 roll
totals more than 6, you must increase the number of
individuals. The referee should feel free to round the
number of hit dice up or down as they see fit, or to
allocate them in an approximately equal fashion if
desired. Trollkin broods are rolled in this way owing to
the fact that bigger or tougher individuals are likely to
kill and eat the weaker ones, generally when their
mother is out hunting.

Refer to the entry for trolls for details regarding
regeneration, morale checks, and so on; except as
noted above, trollkins share all these features with the
adults

Turtles and tortoises are reptiles with a hard shell into
which the animal can pull its head and legs if
threatened. Turtles will be found in marshes and near
rivers or ponds, while tortoises are terrestrial and
typically found in arid regions. (The specific names
given to these animals are often misleading, as a
tortoise might be called a turtle and vice versa.) The
statistics given above are representative, and can be
used for other species as needed. These animals are
well-camouflaged, gaining surprise on a roll of 1-3 on
1d6 in their natural habitat.

Unicorns are horselike creatures having a single spirally-twisted horn in the middle of the forehead. A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.

Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.

Three times per day a unicorn can cast **cure light wounds** by a touch of its horn. Once per day a unicorn can transport itself 360' (as the spell **dimension door**), and can carry a full load (possibly including a rider) while doing so. A light load for a unicorn is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.

An Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid stronger parties.

Alicorns cannot heal or transport themselves by magic as unicorns do. However, alicorns may become invisible at will, exactly as if wearing a **ring of invisibility**.

These creatures appear to be normal **hobgoblins**, but urgoblins are actually a mutant subspecies. Urgoblins are able to regenerate much as do **trolls** (with the same limitations). All urgoblins are male; if an urgoblin mates with a female hobgoblin, any offspring will also be male, but only one in four such offspring will share their father's gifts. Like hobgoblins, urgoblins wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields into battle, blending in perfectly.

Some hobgoblin tribes consider urgoblins an abomination, and kill them whenever they can be identified. Other hobgoblin tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord them great honor. There are even rumors of a tribe entirely made up of urgoblins, with kidnapped hobgoblin females as their mates; reportedly they slit the throats of all infants born to their mates, so that only those who have the power of regeneration survive.

Vampires are **undead** monsters. Though they may
look just a bit more pale than when they were alive,
they do appear to live and even breathe as mortals do.
A vampire has all the memories and abilities it had in
life, and is effectively immortal. Living forever in the
shadows often leads to vampires being decadent, while
their hunger for blood makes them cruel.

Vampires cast no reflections in silvered mirrors or
water, though despite conventional wisdom to the
contrary they do reflect in shiny base metals; the innate
purity of silver and water simply will not reflect them.
A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a
save vs. Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2
due to the power of the charm. This charm is so
powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by
the vampire.

The bite inflicts 1d3 points of damage, then each round
thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim.
The vampire regenerates (i.e. is healed) for up to 1d6
hit points for each energy level drained. If the victim
dies from the energy drain, they will arise as a vampire
at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later) and
thereafter will be under the complete control of the
"parent" vampire (but is freed if that vampire is ever
destroyed).

If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of
-5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must
assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in
combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a
bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons,
and thus a vampire will generally choose to use a melee
weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than
attempting to bite.

Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and
like all undead are immune to **sleep, charm, and hold**
spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire
is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The
vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later,
recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal
activity as soon as the first point is restored.

Creatures of the night obey vampires. Once per day a
vampire can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10
bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming
any such creatures are nearby). The creatures
summoned arrive 2d6 rounds later and will obey the
vampire for up to an hour before leaving.

Vampires can also transform into the form of these
creatures, assuming the shape of a giant bat (page 66),
giant rat (page 135), or a dire wolf (page 158) at will.
The transformation requires a single round during
which the vampire cannot attack. The flying movement
given above is for the giant bat form; the vampire can
use the attack forms of the animal shape assumed, as
given on the indicated pages. The vampire cannot
activate any of its other powers while in animal form,
but effects already active will remain so.

Vampires are powerful indeed, but they do have
several specific weaknesses.

First, a vampire can be held at bay by several things,
including the smell of garlic, a silver or silvered mirror,
or a holy symbol presented by a believer (GM's
discretion is advised here, but in general someone
threatened by a vampire may be more devout than
usual). In such a situation the vampire cannot
approach within 5 feet of the repellent item or
character, nor can it make any melee attacks or
otherwise touch those within the warded area.

**Running water** (such as a stream or river) acts as a
barrier to a vampire; one cannot cross over any such
waterway, neither by bridge or by waterway or even by
flying. It is possible for a vampire to be carried across
while lying in its own coffin with the lid closed; the
presence of the water flowing beneath the coffin will
force the vampire to remain dormant.

Finally, a vampire may not enter any private dwelling
without being invited by someone who resides there,
and then only if invited while the resident is actually
inside the structure. Public buildings of any sort do not
present this problem; even inns are fully accessible to a
vampire.

**Destroying a vampire** is not an easy task. When
reduced to zero hit points or less a vampire becomes
incapacitated but is not slain (as previously explained).
**If exposed to direct sunlight**, the vampire will be
utterly destroyed in a single round if it cannot find a
way to escape in that time. **Being immersed in running water** (as defined above) causes 3d8 points of
damage each round, and if reduced to zero or fewer hit
points in this way the vampire is destroyed. If the
vampire is **cremated in a funeral pyre** while in any
dormant state it will be destroyed.

The most dramatic method of defeating a vampire is
actually the least reliable: **driving a wooden stake through its heart**. Doing this will instantly reduce the
vampire to zero hit points, and it will remain "dead" for
so long as the stake is present. Removal of the stake,
however, allows the vampire to begin regenerating as
described above. It is not normally possible to drive a
stake through a vampire's heart while it is actively
resisting, but this can be done after reducing the
monster to zero hit points in the usual way. Of course,
after staking a vampire it is possible to use sunlight,
running water, or a funeral pyre as described above to
complete its destruction.

Giant water termites vary from 1' to 5' in length. They attack using a noxious spray with a range of 5' which stuns the target for a full turn on a hit; a save vs. Poison is allowed to avoid the effect. A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the remainder of the current round and all of the next one.

However, the primary concern regarding these monsters is the damage they can do to boats and ships. Each creature can do 2d4 points of damage to a ship's hull per round (no roll required) for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus the creature's hit dice total; after this time, the monster is full. They eat noisily.

These creatures are found in fresh and salt water as well as in swamps. The freshwater variety tend to be smaller, 1-2 hit dice, the saltwater variety 3-4 hit dice, and those found in swamps range from 2-3 hit dice.

Normal weasels (or ferrets, see below) are small mammals with long bodies, short legs, and pointed, toothy snouts. They are predatory animals, hunting those creatures smaller than themselves. They are cunning, crafty hunters, and gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6. Once one bites prey (i.e. a living creature smaller than itself), it hangs on, rending with its teeth each round until the victim or the weasel is dead. Should one fail a morale check it will release its victim and flee.

There are many varieties of normal-sized weasel, including several which are called ferrets; in some territories, the giant weasel is thus called a giant ferret. The only distinction is that those which are tamed are always called ferrets, though not all giant ferrets are tame. Various humanoid races as well as some fairy creatures are known to tame giant ferrets for use as guards or war-animals.

Giant weasels resemble their more normally sized cousins, and other than their greater size they behave in exactly the same fashion.

Killer whales, also called "orca" (both singular and plural), are large predatory cetaceans related to both dolphins and true whales. Adult males range from 20 to 26 feet long, while females are smaller at 16 to 23 feet in length. All are strikingly marked in black and white, with prominent white patches that resemble eyes. Their real eyes are much smaller and located away from the fake eye-spots.

Killer whales are apex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They hunt in groups like wolf packs, subsisting primarily on fish, cephalopods, mammals, seabirds, and sea turtles. However, they are not above consuming a meal of humanoid nature if such becomes available.

Narwhals are aquatic mammals resembling large dolphins with a single (or rarely, double) tusk protruding straight forward from the mouth. The tusk is helical in shape, and they are sometimes cut short and sold as "unicorn horns." However, they have no particular magical value. Narwhals are found in cold northern seas. They are not particularly aggressive.

Sperm whales are huge creatures, with males averaging 52 feet long at adulthood while females typically reach a length of around 36 feet. They are predators, hunting primarily giant squid. Sperm whales can emit an invisible focused beam of sound 5' wide up to a 50' range underwater. This blast of sound disorients target creatures, leaving them effectively stunned for 1d4 rounds. A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the indicated duration. No attack roll is required, but a save vs. Death Ray is allowed to resist. A sperm whale can emit as many such blasts of sound as it desires, once per round, instead of biting.

Wights are **undead** monsters who have been twisted and deformed by their transformation. Their eyes are entirely black, and their bodies radiate a coldness that living creatures can feel from several feet away.

If a wight touches or is touched by a living creature, that creature suffers one level of **energy drain** (as described in the [Encounter](combat.qmd#energy-drain) section). No saving throw is allowed. Striking a wight with a weapon does not count as "touching" it, but punching or kicking one does.

Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight by the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later). They are slaves to the wight who created them until and unless that wight is destroyed. Wights remember almost nothing from their previous life, though a few very close friends or loved ones might be recalled (and hated, and possibly hunted by the monster).

Like all undead, wights may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to **sleep**, **charm**,and **hold** magics. Wights are harmed only by silver or magical weapons, and take only half damage from burning oil.

The wolf is a large canine found in a broad range of habitats. They travel in packs consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. Wolves are also territorial, and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hoofed mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, and carrion.

Dire wolves are huge relatives of the ordinary wolves, being as large as horses. They live and hunt in packs, and are sometimes tamed by smaller humanoids as battle steeds or by larger ones as pet

Wraiths are fearsome incorporeal monsters who drain the very life energy from their victims. Being incorporeal, they are immune to non-magical weapons and are effectively flying at all times. They are semitransparent and exude the same kind of coldness as wights. Wraiths usually appear as they were in life, including such things as clothing or armor, though such things do not affect the monsters actual armor class or other statistics.

Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to **sleep**, **charm** and **hold** magics. Due to their incorporeal nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

Wyverns are large dragon-like monsters, though they are built more like bats than lizards, having two legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have four legs and two wings. They are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators with good hunting abilities.

Wyverns are aggressive and always hungry, and will attack almost anything smaller than themselves. Any living creature hit by the wyvern's stinger must save vs. Poison or die. Wyverns can only use their talons to attack when landing or flying past an enemy; while on the ground they may only bite and sting. Further, a wyvern may not bite when flying past an opponent. The only situation in which all attacks can be made is when the monster is landing.

If a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry off its victim; victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most 6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it may be dropped.

If disturbed, a patch of this mold will discharge a cloud of toxic spores. Each patch covers from 10 to 25 square feet; several patches may grow adjacent to each other, and will appear to be a single patch in this case. Each patch can emit a cloud of spores once per day. All within 10 feet of the mold will be affected by the spores and must save vs. Death Ray or take 1d8 points of damage per round for 6 rounds. Brief exposure to sunlight makes a patch of yellow mold dormant, while longer exposures kills it.

Zombies are the **undead** corpses of humanoid creatures. They are deathly slow, but they move silently, are very strong and must be literally hacked to pieces to "kill" them. They take only half damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). A zombie never has Initiative and always acts last in any given round.

As zombies are strong and do not feel pain, they can bludgeon enemies with both fists for 1d8 points of damage. However, their creators often arm them, either for greater damage (as with a greatsword or polearm) or simply for effect.

Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to **sleep**, **charm**, and **hold** magics. As they are mindless, no form of **mind reading** is of any use against them. Zombies never fail morale checks, and thus always fight until destroyed.

A Zombraire is a free-willed undead Magic-User. Like
the zombie it resembles, a zombraire moves silently, is
very strong, and must be literally hacked to pieces to be
destroyed. However, it does not suffer the initiative
penalty common to ordinary zombies. It takes only half
damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point
from arrows, bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical
bonus). It may be Turned by a Cleric (as a wight), and
is immune to **sleep**, **charm**, and **hold** spells.

A zombraire slowly rots away, and as it does it loses its
sanity; this is represented by the variable morale listed.
An insane zombraire fights to the death in hopes of
being slain, thus ending its tortured existence.

The given statistics are for a zombraire formed from a
2nd-level Magic-user; the HD and saving throws of a
zombraire are based on the level it had in life. A
zombraire can cast spells as it did when living, but
cannot learn new spells.

A Skeletaire is the final form of a zombraire which has
rotted away completely. It takes only half damage from
edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows,
bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical bonus). It can
be Turned by a Cleric (as a zombie), and is immune to
sleep, charm, and hold spells. A skeletaire never fails
morale, and thus always fights until destroyed.

The statistics above are for a skeletaire formed from a
2nd-level Magic-user. A skeletaire will have HD equal
to the character's level minus 1, and will save as a
Magic-user of the level equal to its HD. The skeletaire
cannot speak, but still retains the ability to prepare and
cast spells as it did in life (but like a zombraire, it cannot
learn new spells).

The process of creating or becoming a zombraire are
variable, and often involve cursed magic items
(especially cursed scrolls).
