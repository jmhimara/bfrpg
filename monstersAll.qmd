Giant ants are among the hardiest and most adaptable vermin. Soldiers and workers are about 5 to 6 feet long, while queens can grow to a length of 9 feet. Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them. Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair.

Giant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets.

Large and huge ants are similar to giant ants in all ways
except for size; large ants are 1 to 2 feet long, while
huge ants are 3 to 4 feet in length. Though smaller,
their colonies have more members, and so their lair
treasures are of similar size to those found in the lairs of
giant ants.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Antelope" >

## Antelope

|   | Antelope  |
|--------------|----|
| Armor Class: | 13 |
| Hit Dice: | 1 to 4 |
| No. of Attacks: | 1 butt |
| Damage: | 1d4 or 1d6 or 1d8 |
| Movement: | 80' (10') |
| No. Appearing: | Wild 3d10 |
| Save As: | Fighter: 1 to 4 (as Hit Dice) |
| Morale: | 5 (7) |
| Treasure Type: | None |
| XP: | 25 - 240 |

The statistics above represent common sorts of wild herd animals, including deer (1 hit die), aurochs (2 hit dice), elk or moose (3 hit dice) and bison (4 hit dice). Such creatures are often skittish and likely to flee if provoked, but males are more aggressive in the presence of females (the parenthesized morale applies in this case).

Generally, 1 hit die herd animals inflict 1d4 points of
damage on a hit, 2 and 3 hit die animals inflict 1d6, and
4 hit die animals inflict 1d8. The GM should feel free to
vary from these figures as he or she sees fit; there are
many types of herd animals in the world, and some are
better armed than others.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Ape, Carnivorous" >

## Ape, Carnivorous

|   | Ape, Carnivorous  |
|--------------|----|
| Armor Class: | 14 |
| Hit Dice: | 4 |
| No. of Attacks: | 2 claws |
| Damage: | 1d4/1d4 |

These powerful creatures resemble gorillas but are far more aggressive; though they are actually omnivores, they prefer meat, and they kill and eat anything they can catch. An adult male carnivorous ape is 5-1/2 to 6 feet tall and weighs 300 to 400 pounds.

</div>
<div class="monster" data-tag="Assassin Vine" >

## Assassin Vine

|   |  Assassin Vine |
|--------------|----|
| Armor Class: | 15 |
| Hit Dice: | 6 |
| No. of Attacks: | 1 entangle + special |
| Damage: | 1d8 + special |
| Movement: | 5' |
| No. Appearing: | 1d4+1 |
| Save As: | Fighter: 6 |
| Morale: | 12 |
| Treasure Type: | U |
| XP: | 500 |

The assassin vine is a semi-mobile plant found in temperate forests that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots.

Because it can lie very still indeed, an assassin vine surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.

An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.

A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine.

A subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy. These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through with silver, brown, and white veins so that they resemble mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Barkling" >

## Barkling

|                 | Barkling                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Armor Class:    | 15 (11)                  |
| Hit Dice:       | 1/2 (1d4 HP)             |
| No. of Attacks: | 1 bite or 1 weapon       |
| Damage:         | 1d4 bite, or by weapon   |
| Movement:       | 20' Unarmored, 40'       |
| No. Appearing:  | 3d4, Wild 4d6, Lair 5d10 |
| Save As:        | Normal Man               |
| Morale:         | 7 (9)                    |
| Treasure Type:  | P, Q each, C, K in Lair  |
| XP:             | 10                       |

Barklings are diminutive furry humanoids with very
dog-like faces. They stand between 2½ and 3½ feet tall
and typically weigh around 45 pounds. They are pack
hunters by nature, shy when encountered singly or in
small groups but bold when their numbers are
overwhelming. Use the higher morale figure when a
barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3
combatants to 1 or more.

Barklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with
weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature
and relative lack of strength; all such weapons do 1d4
points of damage on a hit.

Barklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a
range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they
excel; a barkling can track almost any living or corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been
as much as a day since it passed.

In combat barklings usually wear chainmail armor
which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor
Class given above).

One out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1
hit die (25 XP). In barkling encampments, one out of
every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP)
having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In
villages of 50 or more there will be a barkling lord of 3
hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage.
Barklings gain a +1 bonus to their morale as long as
they are led by any of their leaders.

In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a
wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is
present). A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior
barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level
1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if
it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level
-1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.

Barklings are sometimes confused with kobolds, for
whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a
kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is
considered a terrible insult.

A basilisk is a giant six-legged lizard-like monster that
petrifies living creatures with its gaze. A basilisk has
dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale
yellow or white belly. Adults reach a body length of 5
to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a
weight of 250 to 400 pounds. There is no particular
difference in size between males and females.

Any living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must
save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone instantly. In
general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet
its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while
averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2
to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the
monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack
and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own
reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or be
turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to
petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other
reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed,
but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster
with a mirror it may see its reflection.

The greater basilisk appears identical to the common
variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of
about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing
between 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greater
basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living
creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare
skin must save vs. Poison or die. This effect persists
even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20
hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to
touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Bat" data-tag2="Giant Bat" >

## Bat (and Bat, Giant)

|  | Bat | Giant Bat |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Armor Class: | 14 | 14 |
| Hit Dice: | 1 Hit Point | 2 |
| No. of Attacks: | 1 special | 1 bite |

Bats are nocturnal flying mammals. The statistics presented here describe small, insectivorous bats. They have a natural sonar that allows them to operate in total darkness; for game purposes, treat this ability as Darkvision.

A group of normal-sized bats has no effective attack (at least in terms of doing damage) but can confuse those in the area, flying around apparently randomly. For every ten bats in the area, one creature can be confused; such a creature will suffer a penalty of -2 on all attack and saving throw rolls while the bats remain in the area.

A giant bat has a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs about 200 pounds. They have the same sensory abilities as normal-sized bats, but being much larger, they are able to attack adventurers; many are carnivorous, making such attacks likely.

</div>
<div class="monster" data-tag="Bear" >

## Bear

Bears attack by rending opponents with their claws, dragging them in and biting them. A successful hit with both paws indicates a hug attack for additional damage (as given for each specific bear type). All bears are very tough to kill, and are able to move and attack for one round after losing all hit points.

</div>
<div class="monster" data-tag="Bear, Black" >

Black bears are omnivorous, and despite their
formidable size and strength are not particularly
aggressive, though a female will fight fiercely if her cubs
are threatened.

</div>
<div class="monster" data-tag="Bear, Cave" >

These monstrous bears are even larger than grizzly bears. They are ferocious killers, attacking almost anything of equal or smaller size.

</div>
<div class="monster" data-tag="Bear, Grizzly (or Brown)" >

### Bear, Grizzly (or Brown)

Brown bears are huge, carnivorous, and aggressive. An
adult male weighs 400 to 800 pounds and four feet
high at the shoulder; females are slightly smaller, but
just as bloodthirsty.

Giant bees live in hives, generally in underground areas.
In each such hive will be a queen who has 2 hit dice and
inflicts only a bite doing 1d8 points of damage. She is
immobile, and if she is threatened all bees in the hive will
fight without checking morale. The queen is worth 75 XP
if defeated.

Those stung by a giant bee must save vs. Poison or die. A
giant bee that successfully stings another creature pulls
away, leaving its stinger in the creature; the bee then dies.

Each giant bee hive will contain honeycomb filled with
honey, which is entirely safe to eat and is worth 10 GP per
gallon if carefully removed. Generally 2d10+10 gallons of
honey will be present in any given hive. There is also a
15% chance that one of the cells in the honeycomb will
contain special honey which acts as 1d6+1 [Potions of Healing](magicItems.qmd#potions) if consumed. This honey can be discovered by chance, or through the use of [detect magic](allSpells.qmd#detect-magic).

<div class="monster" data-tag="Beetle, Giant Bombardier" >

Giant bombardier beetles have red head and thorax sections and black abdomens. They are 3 to 4 feet long. In combat, a giant bombardier beetle bites opponents in front of it, and sprays a cone of very hot and noxious gases from a nozzle in the rearmost tip of the abdomen. This toxic blast causes 2d6 points of damage to all within a cone 10' long and 10' wide at the far end (a save vs. Death Ray for half damage is allowed). A giant bombardier beetle can use this spray attack up to five times per day, but no more often than once per three rounds. Faced with opponents attacking from just one direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to turn away and use the spray attack rather than biting.

Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have more or less the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.

</div>
<div class="monster" data-tag="Beetle, Giant Fire" >

Giant fire beetles are huge, being 18 to 30 inches long,
and have shiny black carapaces. Each has a pair of
glowing red organs located just below their eyes which
illuminate a radius of 10 feet around the creature.
These glands continue to glow for 1d6 days after one is
killed, and may be removed and used for illumination
by any adventurers not too squeamish to do so.

They are normally timid but will fight if cornered. Like
most beetles, they have more or less the same visual
acuity in all directions, and thus those who attack them
from behind receive no bonus to do so.

Giant oil beetles are about 3 feet long, and are often
found burrowing in soil or roaming dungeon corridors.
Their eyes are arranged on the sides of their heads such
that they can see perfectly well behind them as well as
in front, negating any normal bonus for attacking from
behind.

In addition to its bite, a giant oil beetle can attack with a
spray of oil from its abdomen; this can only be applied
to opponents within 5 feet of the back of the beetle,
and an attack roll is needed to hit. Living creatures hit
by this spray suffer a penalty of -2 on all attack rolls for
24 hours due to painful blisters inflicted by the irritating
oil. A [cure light wounds](allSpells.qmd#cure-light-wounds) spell may be used to remove
this effect, but if so used the spell does not also restore
hit points to the victim

<div class="monster" data-tag="Beetle, Giant Tiger" >

Giant tiger beetles are predatory monsters around 5 feet long. Their carapaces tend to be dark brown with lighter brown striped or spotted patterns, but there are many variations.

They are fast runners, depending on their speed to run down prey, and they willingly prey on any creature of man size or smaller. Like most beetles, they have more or less the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.

Black puddings are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic matter, living or dead. They attack any creatures they encounter, lashing out with pseudopods or simply engulfing opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that help them catch and digest their prey.

If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with lightning or electricity, a black pudding suffers no injury, but will be split into two puddings; the GM should divide the original black pudding's hit dice between the two however he or she sees fit, with the limitation that neither pudding may have less than two hit dice. A two hit die black pudding is simply unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split further.

Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black pudding, but such an attack will paralyze the pudding for one round per die of damage the attack would normally cause. Other attack forms will affect a black pudding normally; the preferred method of killing one usually involves fire.

The typical black pudding measures 10 feet across and 2 feet thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black puddings of smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly as a result of the splitting described above.

Blink dogs, also known as flicker beasts, are strange
creatures which resemble wolves or hyenas who can
teleport up to 120 feet at will. Teleportation is so easy
for them that they can sometimes teleport away before
being attacked; specifically, when a flicker beast know
of the attacker’ presence. The flicker beast is allowed a
saving throw vs. Death Ray, and on a successful roll
teleports 1d6 x 10 feet in a random direction (but never
into solid matter, nor into any dangerous area the
creature knows about).

These creatures are pack hunters, using their
teleportation to confuse their prey until they are able to
surround it. In this way, some members of the pack will
be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good
at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to
hit and double damage if the hit is successful.

Blink dogs are large canines, typically light brown in
color with short bristly hair; some varieties are striped or
spotted. They communicate using a language of barks,
growls, and yips which is somewhat limited but can
convey useful tactical information. They are shy,
generally avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate
[deceivers](monstersAll.qmd#deceiver-panther-hydra) and will generally attack them on sight.

Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually animated plants, dimly aware of their surroundings. These plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.

The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30' from the plant in ideal conditions. Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save vs. Poison or become befuddled, dropping anything carried and approaching the plant. Each round such a creature or character is within the affected area, this save must be made. Befuddled characters will not resist the plant-creature's attacks; if affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters, constructs, etc. are not affected.

Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded with thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day) "eaten" this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed.

Though not carnivores, these wild swine are bad-tempered and usually charge anyone who disturbs them. Note that "boar" refers specifically to the male of the species, but females are equally large and fierce.

A boar is covered in coarse, grayish-black fur. Adults are about 4 feet long and 3 feet high at the shoulder.

Bugbears look like huge, hairy goblins, standing about 6 feet tall. Their eyes are usually a darkish brown color and they move very quietly. They are wild and relatively fearless, and bully smaller humanoids whenever possible.

Bugbears prefer to ambush opponents if they can. When hunting, they often send scouts ahead of the main group. Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant. They are able to move in nearly complete silence, surprising opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. In order to remain silent, they must wear only leather or hide armor, as indicated in the Armor Class scores above. Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage due to their great Strength. As with most goblinoid monsters, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.

One out of every eight bugbears will be a hardened warrior of 4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to damage. In lairs of 16 or more bugbears, there will be a chieftain of 6+6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with a +3 bonus to damage. Bugbears gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a hardened warrior or chieftain. In the lair, bugbears never fail a morale check as long as the chieftain is alive. In addition, there is a 2 in 6 chance that a shaman will be present in a lair. A shaman is equal to an ordinary bugbear statistically, but possesses 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities.

Caecilia are carnivorous, legless amphibians; they strongly resemble earthworms, but they have bony skeletons and sharp teeth. Caecilia live entirely underground. The giant variety grows up to 30' long and frequently are found in caverns or dungeons. They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.

A caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid or demi-human (such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers 1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit, fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to the attack roll are applied.

Once a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and digest its meal.

Cattle are large mammals with cloven hooves and
horned heads. Cattle are raised mostly for their meat
(beef), leather, and milk. Cattle eat grass and are fairly
gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede
(run in a group). Anyone caught in the path of the
stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as
determined by the GM. Male cattle are called bulls,
females are cows, and young are calves (calf is
singular). If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using
their horns to attack. Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less
easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure),
and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd. A bull
will likely attack if he sees quick movements from
creatures he might be able to reach with a charge.
Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a
roughly circular formation with their heads outward,
while calves will be kept in the center, though if the
opponents are small enough they may instead charge
en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.

A typical small farm with cattle will have a bull, 5d4
cows, and 2d10 calves (but not more than the number
of cows).

Aurochs are wild cattle; they are shaggy and rough-
looking. Bison are the largest species of wild bovines.
All types of bovines tend to behave in the same general
way, as described above.

An ox is typically a castrated bull used as a draft animal;
females may be used, rarely, but males are preferred
due to their greater size and strength. Oxen are usually
paired as a team to pull a fully-loaded wagon (or the
equivalent of 3,000 lb). Oxen require less food and
water, being able to eat rough grass better than draft
horses, which makes them valuable to merchants with
large caravans going over semi-arid prairie.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Cave Locust, Giant">

Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that live underground. An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long. They are eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a variety of touch-sensitive "hairs" on their legs to sense the environment around them.

These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.

All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed, attracting wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.

Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not interrupt the monster's shrieking.

A giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to 30' up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.

Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10' away. Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell.

Cavemen are a species closely related to humans; they are shorter and stockier, and much more heavily muscled. They do not all actually live in caves. Whether they are actually less intelligent than "normal" humans or not is a matter of debate, but it is true that they do not have the facility for language as other human, demi-human and humanoid races.

Centaurs appear to be half man, half horse, having the torso, arms and head of a man in the position a horse's head would otherwise occupy. A centaur is as big as a heavy horse, but much taller and slightly heavier; average males are about 7 feet tall and weigh about 2,100 pounds, and females are just a bit smaller. Centaurs may charge with a spear or lance just as a man on horseback, with the same bonuses. They typically wear leather armor when prepared for combat.

Centaurs are generally haughty and aloof, but very honorable. Most would rather die than allow humans, demi-humans, or humanoids to ride on their backs.

Giant centipedes are larger versions of the normal sort, being 2 to 3 feet long. Centipedes are fast-moving, predatory, venomous arthropods, having long segmented bodies with exoskeletons. They prefer to live in underground areas, shadowy forested areas, and other places out of direct sunlight; however, there are desert-dwelling varieties that hide under the sand waiting for prey to wander by.

Giant centipedes tend to attack anything that resembles food, biting with their jaws and injecting their poison. Those bitten by a giant centipede must save vs. Poison at +2 or die.

Chimeras are strange creatures having a lion's body with the heads of a lion, a goat, and a dragon, and the wings of a dragon. A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera's dragon head might be black, blue, green, red, or white, and has the same type of breath weapon as that sort of dragon. Regardless of type, the dragon's head breathes a 50' long cone with a 10' wide end, for 3d6 points of damage; victims may save vs. Dragon Breath for one-half damage.

Chimeras are cruel and voracious. They can speak Dragon but seldom bother to do so, except when toadying to more powerful creatures.

A cockatrice is a strange creature, appearing to be a chicken (hen or rooster) with a long serpentine neck and tail; the neck is topped by a more or less normal looking chicken head.

A male cockatrice has wattles and a comb, just like a rooster. Females, much rarer than males, differ only in that they have no wattles or comb. A cockatrice weighs about 25 pounds. A cockatrice is no more intelligent than any animal, but they are bad-tempered and prone to attack if disturbed.

Anyone touched by a cockatrice, or who touches one (even if gloved), must save vs. Petrification or be turned to stone.

Giant crabs naturally resemble the ordinary variety, but are much larger, averaging 5' in diameter (not counting their legs). These creatures are often found in water-filled caves, particularly those connected to a river, lake or sea, and are tolerant of both fresh and salt water. Also, they are able to live in stagnant water, though they prefer a better environment.

Giant crabs carry their eyes on armored stalks, which means that no bonus is awarded for attacking them from behind.

Crocodiles are aggressive predators 11 to 12 feet long. They lie mostly submerged in rivers or marshes, with only their eyes and nostrils showing, waiting for prey to come within reach; when in their natural element, they surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.

**Large Crocodiles:** These huge creatures are from 12-20 feet long. Large crocodiles fight and behave like their smaller cousins.

Displacers are blue-black, catlike monsters with strange bladed winglike arms extending from their shoulders. The blades are carried folded back like wings, but the Displacer swings the blades around in front to attack.

The real power and danger of the Displacer is its power of **displacement**, which causes the monster's apparent location to shift around constantly over a range of 3' from the monster's true location. This is a form of illusion, but a powerful form that cannot be seen through even by those who know the secret.

Any character fighting a Displacer for the first time will miss his or her first strike regardless of the die roll. Thereafter, all attacks against displacers will be at a penalty of -2 to the attack roll. This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind. Some monsters, such as bats, do not depend on vision to fight and thus may be able to perceive the monster's true location and fight without penalty.

The Deinonychus (sometimes mistakenly called a "Velociraptor") is a medium-sized feathered dinosaur weighting approximately 150 pounds and reaching about 11 feet of length (tail included). It is an avid predator and a skilled pack-hunter; its warm blood, aerodynamic build and vicious maw allow it to feed on larger but more primitive dinosaurs.

Pterodactyls are prehistoric winged reptilian creatures, having a wingspan of around 25 to 30 inches. Though they eat mostly fish, they may attack smaller characters or scavenge unguarded packs.

Pteranodons are essentially giant-sized pterodactyls, having wingspans of 25 feet or more. They are predators, and may attack adventuring parties.

Although fearsome looking, the stegosaurus is actually a
peaceable creature and will only fight in self-defense,
either biting, trampling, or using its spiked tail,
depending on where the opponent is standing in
relation to the dinosaur. A stegosaurus can't use its tail
and bite attacks against the same creature in the same
round, and cannot use either bite or tail on any round
where it tramples.

A triceratops is a three-horned herbivorous dinosaur.
They are aggressive toward interlopers, attacking
anyone who might appear to be a threat. Individuals
are quite large, weighing 11,000 to 20,000 pounds and
ranging from 26 to 30 feet in length.

When facing opponents of smaller size, a triceratops will
usually attempt to trample them, reserving the gore
attack for larger opponents. Up to two adjacent man-
sized or up to four smaller opponents may be trampled
simultaneously; the triceratops rolls a single attack roll
which is compared to the Armor Class of each of the
potential victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll
for each one successfully hit. The gore attack may only
be used against a single man-sized or larger creature,
but may be used in the same round as the trample if
the creature being gored is larger than man sized. Also
note that a charging bonus may be applied to the gore
attack.

The tyrannosaurus rex is a bipedal carnivorous
dinosaur with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy
tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, its
forelimbs are short but unusually powerful for their size,
with two clawed digits. Despite this, they are not used
to attack, as the tyrannosaur's powerful bite is its
preferred weapon.

Individuals can grow to lengths of over 40 feet and can
weigh up to 20,000 pounds, though most are a bit
smaller than this, averaging around 35 feet in length
and 17,000 pounds in weight.

The statistics above can also be used to represent other
large bipedal carnosaurs, such as the allosaurus.

The djinn (singular djinni) are humanoid creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air. A djinni in its natural form is about 10½ feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind (see below) to harass those who follow; the 12 morale reflects a djinni's absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the "8" figure to determine whether an outmatched djinn decides to leave a combat.

Djinn have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): **create food and drink**, creating tasty and nourishing food for up to 2d6 humans or similar creatures, once per day; become **invisible**, with unlimited uses per day; **create normal items**, creating up to 1,000 pounds of soft goods or wooden items of permanent nature or metal goods lasting at most a day, once per day; assume **gaseous form**, as the potion, up to one hour per day; and **create illusions**, as the spell **phantasmal force** but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day.

Djinn may assume the form of a whirlwind at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; a djinni in whirlwind form fights as if it were an air elemental.

Due to their highly magical nature, djinn cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal cold, and suffer only half damage from magical attacks based on either cold or wind.

Normal dogs include most medium and large breeds, including wild dogs. After biting an opponent, a dog can hold on, doing 1d4 damage automatically every round, until killed or until the victim spends an attack breaking free (which requires a save vs. Death Ray, adjusted by the character's Strength bonus).

Riding dogs are a large breed, used primarily by Halflings for transport. They may be trained for war, and equipped with barding to improve their Armor Class. They can maintain a hold in the same way that normal dogs do. A light load for a riding dog is up to 150 pounds; a heavy load, up to 300 pounds.

Dopplegangers are weird humanoid creatures who are
able to take on the appearance of nearly any other
humanoid ranging from 3 feet up to 7 feet in height.
They can also read minds (as the spell, **mind reading**,
but with unlimited duration), an ability that can even be
used to speak any language known to the creature
whose mind is being read. In their natural form (which
few creatures ever see) they are pale and pasty looking,
slim, around 5½ feet tall and weighing about 150
pounds. Their features look unformed and incomplete.

Dopplegangers wish to live a life of ease, and in pursuit
of that goal they will seek to take the place of any
character they meet who they believe can help them get
that kind of life. This usually means separating the
victim from any allies and quietly killing them. While a
doppleganger can duplicate the appearance of the
clothing and equipment worn by a creature, such items
are part of the creature and cannot, for example, be
laid down or handed to someone. Taking the clothing
and equipment of a victim is thus the preferred tactic.

A doppleganger can mimic the sound of the voice of
any living creature as well as the appearance of any
humanoid. Their **mind reading** ability will be used to
help them behave like the person they have replaced.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Dragon" >

## Dragon

Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish "true" dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven "age categories," ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.

If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are protecting their young.

A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long, whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).

Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.

The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can bite those behind it.

There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a "normal" shape, which that type of dragon can use from the second age category (-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2 hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category (+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three shapes.

The shapes are:

**Cone Shaped:** The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and age).

**Line Shaped:** The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given length in a straight line.

**Cloud Shaped:** The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most, 20' deep or high.

All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of "talking;" this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn Elvish. If the first roll for "talking" is successful, the GM may roll again, with each additional roll adding another language which the dragon may speak.

Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for separately.

Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It's pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the highest age category would have about double the given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).

Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog. Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items.

Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).

Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A black dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while lying in wait underwater.

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed, waiting until opponents come within 100 feet to spring out and attack (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems, especially sapphires. Blue dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person as a cat plays with a mouse.

Blue dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only half damage from magical lightning.

Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. Those having spellcasting ability make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are **cloudkill**, **sleep**, and **slow**.

All gold dragons have the power to assume human form at will (in a manner equivalent to the spell **polymorph self**, but performed at will).

Unlike many other dragons, gold dragons are not cruel and do not seek to kill for pleasure. Many tales are told of gold dragons offering assistance to adventurers. They are, however, every bit as avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold need not bother asking for a loan.

Gold dragons are immune to all poisons, as well as normal fire. They suffer only half damage from magical fire.

Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing or seems formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to determine the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon makes its presence known quickly -- it enjoys evoking terror.

Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby. Adventurers may be allowed to live so long as they remain interesting... but woe to them when the dragon becomes bored.

Green dragons are immune to all poisons. Note that, despite their breath weapon being described as "poison gas," damage done by it is exactly the same as with other dragons. More specifically, those in the area of effect do not have to "save or die" as with ordinary poison, but rather save vs. Breath Weapon for half damage.

Because red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked out ahead of time. A red dragon lands to attack small, weak creatures with its claws and bite rather than obliterating them with its breath weapon, so as not to destroy any treasure they might be carrying.

Red dragons are cruel monsters, actively seeking to hunt, torment, kill and consume intelligent creatures. They are often said to prefer women and elves, but in truth a red dragon will attack almost any creature less powerful than itself.

Red dragons are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire.

Though they live in the water and are somewhat adapted to it, Sea Dragons still must breathe air, similar to dolphins or whales. A Sea Dragon may hold its breath up to three turns while swimming or performing other moderate activity.

These dragons have much the same physical structure as other dragons, but their feet are webbed and their tails are short, flat and broad; these adaptations help the sea dragon swim efficiently, but severely limit their ability to walk on dry land. Unlike other dragons, sea dragons do not have a tail attack. The breath weapon of a sea dragon is a cloud of steam; they are immune to damage from non-magical steam (including the breath weapon of another sea dragon), and suffer only half damage from magical steam attacks.

Young sea dragons are light bluish-gray in color (similar to dolphins), darkening to a deep slate color in older individuals.

Sea dragons are neutral in outlook, in much the same way as white dragons. They often maintain lairs in air-filled undersea caverns.

White Dragons prefer to live in cold regions, whether in the highest mountains or in the cold northern lands. They are the least intelligent of dragons, though this does not mean that they are stupid by any stretch of the imagination. They are motivated completely by a drive to live, to reproduce, and (of course) to accumulate treasure; they kill to live, not for pleasure.

White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. Typically, a white dragon begins with its icy breath weapon, then tries to eliminate a single opponent with a follow-up attack.

White dragons are immune to normal cold, and take only half damage from magical cold or ice.

A dragon turtle's rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell resemble light dancing on open water. The turtle's legs, tail, and head are a lighter green, flecked with golden highlights. An adult dragon turtle can measure from 100 to 200 feet from snout to tail. They are occasionally mistaken for rocky outcroppings or even small islands.

Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and generally attack any creature that threatens their territory or looks like a potential meal. Though they are not true dragons, they do advance through the same sort of age categories as the true dragons do; however, each age category changes the dragon turtle's Hit Dice by 5.

style="position: absolute; top: 0in; left: 0in" Due to their massive size, dragon turtles are immune to virtually all poisons.

Dryads are female nature spirits; each is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad's oak does not radiate magic. A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.

A dryad's delicate features are much like a female elf's, though her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons. Although they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been encountered in one place on rare occasions.

Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they are alluring -- they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a dryad can charm (as the spell **charm person**), attempting to gain control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into a frenzied defense.

Eagles are large birds with wingspans 6½ to 7½ feet in
width. They stand about 2½ to 3 feet tall and weigh
about 13 lbs. These birds have heavy talons and large
beaks with a sharp hooked end. Eagles are known to
carry prey up to 15 lbs. An eagle will also kill and start 
to eat animals that are 5 times the eagles size, up to 80
lbs. The largest eagles tend to be fish-eating or sea
eagles, while other types of eagles will eat snakes or
small animals. Coloring is dependent on the species of
eagle from dark browns with a white head, to fully
brown, to various grays ranging from black to white.
The beaks can be bright yellowish orange to black.
Eagles will fly at a prey and attack with both sets of
talons, then attack with the beak.

An average giant eagle has a wingspan of 15 to 20 feet
and stands 8 to 12 feet tall. They are intelligent
creatures, and many speak Common or another
language common in their home territory.

Individual giant eagles are rarely encountered alone, as
they prefer to live in loose communities. However,
when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with
each eagle choosing a single creature as prey. As they
can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare
for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the
same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack
alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more
easily choose a victim.

Giant eagles mate for life. If a nest with eggs or
hatchlings is threatened, both parents will fight without
checking morale, and other giant eagles in their
community may come to their defense but will still seek
to scatter any opponents so as to attack them one on
one

The efreet (singular efreeti) are humanoid creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire. An efreeti in its natural form stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Efreet are malicious by nature. They love to mislead, befuddle, and confuse their foes. They do this for enjoyment as much as for tactical reasons.

Note that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti's absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the "9" figure to determine whether an outmatched efreeti decides to leave a combat.

Efreet have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): become **invisible**, with unlimited uses per day; assume **gaseous form**, as the potion, up to one hour per day; **create illusions**, as the spell **phantasmal force** but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day; **create flame**, with unlimited uses; and create a **wall of fire** (as the spell), once per day. Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torchflame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60', causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit. The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well if desired, once per round.

Efreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.

Due to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire attacks.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Elemental*" >

## Elemental*

An elemental is a being formed from one of the
foundational elements of reality. In Western traditions,
the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water;
Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth,
metal, water, and wood. This book presents the full
range needed for either tradition, and to those types are
added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish
to be less traditional. As always, the Game Master
decides what sort of monsters appear in their world,
and so not all of the following creatures may be
encountered.

Each type of elemental may be summoned to the
material plane by means of one of three different
methods:

Conjured by the 5th level Magic-User spell [conjure elemental](allSpells.qmd#conjure-elemental); or,

Summoned by means of a magical **staff**; or,

Summoned by a device (as given in the [Miscellaneous Magic](magicItems.qmd#miscellaneous-magic-items) subsection of the Treasure section of this book.

These three types of elementals are quite reasonably
called staff, device, and conjured elementals. The hit
dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:

| Type | Hit Dice |
|------|----------|
| Staff | 8  |
| Device |  12 |
| Conjured |  16 |


The summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it
to control it, and may take no other action, including
attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be
lost. Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the
uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the
summoner and attack.

Elementals must be summoned from a large quantity of
the appropriate natural material. For example, air
elementals require a large quantity of air (so small
underground spaces will not support the summoning of
one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or
stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a
castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire
such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access
to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river
or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work).
Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other
elemental of the same type may be summoned in the
same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.

Non-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental.
Attacks made by an elemental should be considered
magical for purposes of determining how much damage
creatures resistant to the elemental's attack form should
suffer.

Generally, elementals are immune to both normal and
magical forms of their own attack form. Most are more
susceptible to attacks from one or two specific other
types of elemental; this is noted in the text for each
type.

Air elementals resemble "dust devils," that is, small whirlwinds, but they are much more powerful. Air elementals take double damage when attacked by earth-based attacks (including by earth elementals). An air elemental may choose either to attack a single opponent, thus receiving one attack per round at the listed damage, or may choose to knock all opponents in a 5' radius to the ground; if the latter attack is used, all creatures of 2 hit dice or less must save vs. Death Ray or fall prone. Creatures of 3 or more levels or hit dice are not so affected. Air elementals do an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures or vehicles which are airborne.

A cold elemental resembles a crude, headless ice statue
with long sharp icicles in place of hands. A cold
elemental suffers double damage from fire attacks,
including the attacks of fire elementals. It deals an
additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures that
are hot or flaming in nature, as well as creatures made
of liquids or jelly. A cold elemental's body is so bitterly
cold that creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of
damage automatically, unless they are immune to the
effects of cold. Any liquids the cold elemental touches
immediately freeze solid. A cold elemental cannot enter
places where the temperature is above 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, and if forced to do so will suffer 1d6 points
of damage each round.

Earth elementals resemble crude, headless humanoid statues, with clublike hands and feet. They cannot cross a body of water wider than their own height. Earth elementals take double damage when attacked by fire (including fire elementals). They do an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures, vehicles, or structures which rest on the ground.

Fire elementals are simply flames, which may appear generally humanoid for brief moments when they attack. Fire elementals take double damage when attacked by water (including water elementals). They cannot cross a body of water wider than their own diameter. They do an additional 1d8 points of damage against creatures which are cold or icy in nature.

Remember that a fire elemental is constantly burning; such a creature may easily start fires if it moves into an area containing items which burn easily, such as dry wood, paper, or oil. No specific rules are given for such fires, but the GM is directed to the rules for burning oil for an example of fire damage.

A lightning elemental resembles dark clouds lit from
within by flashes of lightning. One can magnetically
draw metal items towards itself as if using [telekinesis](allSpells.qmd#telekinesis).
It deals 1d8 extra points of damage to creatures that are
in contact with water or metal but not touching solid
ground. A lightning elemental takes double damage
when attacked by air or wind attacks (including air
elementals), and from the attacks of wood elementals
as well. A lightning elemental can choose either to
strike a single creature or create a mighty thunderclap.
If the latter attack is used, all creatures within a 30 foot
radius must save vs. Paralysis or be deafened for 1d8
turns

Metal elementals appear to be somewhat abstract
humanoid figures formed from metal. They are able to
move as if liquid, though they are cool and hard to the
touch. Their semi-liquid form permits them to form
their extremities into wickedly sharp blades, which is
their preferred means of attack. Those wearing metal
armor receive no protection against a metal elemental
(except for magical bonuses, if any); indeed, on a
successful hit one deals an additional 1d8 points of
damage to creatures, vehicles, or structures that are
made of or in direct contact with some form of metal.
Lightning attacks deal double damage to a metal
elemental. Like an earth elemental, a metal elemental
cannot cross a body of water greater than its own
height.

which seem to fall upon any creature attacked, only to
reform the next round. They take double damage

points of damage against creatures, vehicles, or

A wood elemental appears to be a large, leafless tree.
They deal 1d8 points of extra damage to creatures in

or lightning attacks of any kind, including the attacks of
fire or lightning elementals.

A light load for an African elephant is 7,500 pounds; a
heavy load, up to 15,000 pounds. For an Asiatic
elephant, a light load is up to 7,000 pounds, and a
heavy load up to 14,000 pounds.

Though elephants have five distinct attack modes (two
tusks, a trunk grab, and two tramples with the front
feet), a single elephant can apply no more than two of
these attacks to any single opponent of small or
medium size; large opponents may be targeted by three
of these attacks in a round. However, an elephant can
attack multiple opponents in its immediate area at the
same time.

An elephant has no treasure as such, but the tusks of an
elephant are worth 1d8 x 100 gp each.

Falcons are birds with wingspans of 16 to 20 inches;
they stand about 1.5 to 2 feet tall and weigh about 3
pounds. These are the most popular of the hunting
birds used by royalty. Falcons can only carry prey up
to 1 pound. They will hunt snakes, small rodents, and
even other birds such as wild ducks. Falcons appear in
a variety of colors, typically ranging from dark gray on
top to white with dark stripes on the bottom; kestrels, a
variety of falcon, have reddish brown to dark brown
feathers with dark stripes. A falcon typically attacks
prey by diving, striking first with the talons before
making the kill with its sharp beak.

Barracuda are predatory fish found in salt water. Huge barracudas are about 12' long, while giant specimens can exceed 20'. They have elongated bodies, pointed heads and prominent jaws. Their bodies are covered with smooth scales, typically blue, gray or silver in color. They have extremely keen eyesight and are surprised only on a 1 on 1d6. Due to the quickness of their attack, barracudas are themselves capable of surprising on 1-3 on 1d6 and gain a +2 bonus to Initiative.

Giant barracudas always appear singly and are 50% likely to break off the attack after 1d4 rounds if they haven't killed their prey. Both kinds are attracted to shiny objects.

Giant bass are generally between 10' and 25' long. Most are greenish-grey, marked with dark lateral stripes, though some are almost completely black. They are generally found in lakes or rivers, as they are not adapted for salt water.

Giant bass are predatory, and on a natural attack roll of 20 a giant bass will swallow whole a dwarf-sized or smaller creature, which then takes 2d4 damage per round until it is dead. Swallowed characters can attack only with daggers or similar short weapons. Note that each giant bass can swallow at most one character, and a giant bass which has swallowed a character will attempt to retreat (having achieved its goal).

Giant catfish fins are edged with a natural poison that causes a painful burning sensation for 3d10 rounds if a save vs. Poison is failed. The pain causes the affected character or creature to suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws; further poisonings will increase this penalty by -1 each, down to a maximum penalty of -5 as well as adding 6 rounds to the duration of the poison effect.

Because of its large size (15 to 20 feet long) and body design, a giant catfish cannot target more than one of its attacks on any single creature; that is, it cannot bite and fin the same opponent, nor use both fins on one victim.

Giant frogs are enlarged versions of the common frog; most resemble bullfrogs in appearance, but an adult giant frog is 3' long and weighs about 250 pounds. They are predators, but will normally only attack creatures smaller than themselves. Giant toads are statistically just like giant frogs; however, they are often found in "drier" areas as they do not have to maintain a wet skin surface.

A giant frog can stretch its tongue out up to 15' and drag up to dwarf-sized prey to its mouth; on every subsequent round, the victim is hit automatically. On a natural 20 attack roll, the victim is swallowed whole, taking 1d6 damage per round thereafter. Each giant frog can swallow only one such victim.

Gargoyles are demonic-looking winged humanoid monsters with gray stone-like skin. They are often mistaken for winged stone statues, for they can remain still indefinitely without moving. Gargoyles use this disguise to ambush their foes, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 if their foes do not otherwise suspect them. They are cruel monsters, inflicting pain on other creatures for the sole purpose of enjoyment.

Gargoyles require no food, water, or air. Due to their highly magical nature, they can only be harmed by magical weapons.

The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash. Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside the cube's body. A typical gelatinous cube is ten feet on a side and weighs about 15,000 pounds; however, smaller specimens have been reported.

A gelatinous cube attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It is capable of lashing out with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs foes. Any character hit by a gelatinous cube must save vs. Paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d4 turns.

Any treasure indicated will be visible inside the creature, which must be slain if the treasure is to be recovered.

Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost normally resembles the form it had in life, but sometimes the spiritual form is altered. For instance, the ghost of someone who believed he or she was evil might look a bit demonic. Because they are incorporeal, ghosts may be hit only by magical weapons.

Seeing a ghost is so terrible that the victim must save vs. Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. A character or creature who successfully saves vs. a given ghost's **fear** attack may not be so affected by that ghost again, but of course may still be affected by another.

A ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8 points of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same number of hit points. In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit. Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the GM should assign whatever score he or she sees fit.

Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of **restoration**; nothing else (except a **wish**) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character's Constitution falls to 0, he or she dies permanently and cannot be **raised** (but still may be **reincarnated**).

Once per turn, a ghost can use **telekinesis** (as the spell) as if it were a 10^th^ level Magic-User.

Instead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living creature. This ability is similar to a **magic jar** spell (as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be able to move into the target (so it is possible to outrun it). The target can resist the attack with a successful save vs. Spells. A creature that successfully saves is immune to being possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the save fails, the ghost enters the target's body and controls it; control may be maintained until the ghost chooses to leave the victim's body, or until it is driven out by means of a **remove curse** spell. While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not use any of its special abilities.

**Ghouls** are **undead** monsters which eat the flesh of
dead humanoids to survive. They are vile, disgusting
carrion-eaters, but are more than willing to kill for food.
Those slain by ghouls will generally be stored until they
begin to rot before the ghouls will actually eat them.

Living creatures hit by a ghoul’s bite or claw attack
must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns.
Elves are immune to this paralysis. Ghouls try to attack
with surprise whenever possible, striking from behind
tombstones or bursting from shallow graves; when they
attack in this way, they are able to surprise opponents
on 1-3 on 1d6. Like all undead, they may be [Turned](combat.qmd#turning-the-undead)
by Clerics and are immune to [sleep](allSpells.qmd#sleep), [charm](allSpells.qmd#charm-person), and [hold](allSpells.qmd#hold-person) magics.

Humanoids bitten by ghouls may be infected with
ghoul fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a
5% chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted
humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save
is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.

An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a
ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes
a ghoul in this way retains none of the knowledge or
abilities they possessed in life. The newly-risen ghoul is
not under the control of any other ghouls, but hungers
for the flesh of the living and behaves like any other
ghoul in all respects.

**Ghasts** look and fight almost exactly like ghouls, but
they are smarter and just a bit more powerful. Refer to
the previous paragraphs for information about their
claw attacks and other abilities.

The stink of death and corruption surrounding these
creatures is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10
feet must succeed on a save vs. Poison or be sickened
for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack rolls). A creature that
successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same
ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A [neutralize poison](allSpells.qmd#neutralize-poison) spell
removes the effect from a sickened creature.

They may be Turned by Clerics using the same column
as the ghoul, but as they are superior to ghouls, in a
mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GM should apply
Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.

Humanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast
fever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10%
chance of the infection being passed. The afflicted
humanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save
is failed, the humanoid dies within a day.

An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a
ghast at the next midnight, in a similar fashion to the
ghoul. However, a humanoid who becomes a ghast in
this way retains all of the knowledge and abilities they
possessed in life, unless those abilities are directly
incompatible with the creature's new form (as decided
by the GM). For such ghasts, the GM should also
adjust XP values to include any such abilities. The
newly-risen ghast is not under the control of any other
ghasts, but hungers for the flesh of the living and
behaves like any other ghast in all respects.

Cloud giants' skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky blue. They have hair of silvery white or brass, and their eyes are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.

Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or more instruments (the harp is a favorite). Like most giants, they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand tribute from humans, demi-humans, or humanoids living nearby.

Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. Cloud giants can throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage each. Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 8 (2d4). A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells. In battle, cloud giants wear finely crafted, intricately engraved plate mail.

A cyclops is a one-eyed giant. Huge and brutish, they most resemble hill giants, and even dress in the same "style," layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left on, unwashed and unrepaired.

They are reclusive and unfriendly to almost all of the smaller races.

A cyclops can throw a large rock up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage, but they aim poorly and thus suffer an attack penalty of -2. Once per year, a cyclops can cast the spell [bestow curse](allSpells.qmd#remove-curse) (the reverse of the spell **remove curse**).

Despite their great size, fire giants have a Dwarf-like
appearance, being barrel-chested with thick arms and
legs; average males stand 14 feet tall and weigh around
3,200 pounds, while females average 13 feet tall and
around 3,000 pounds. Their skin is ruddy, their hair is
black, and their eyes are a very dark red that is almost
black (and looks that color in poor lighting).

Fire giants are unfriendly to almost all other humanoid
races, though they sometimes subjugate those living
nearby to act as their servants.

In combat they favor heavy plate steel armor (the first
AC given above) made of steel blackened by
quenching in oil. They arm themselves with massive
weapons made of the same material. A fire giant can
throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage.
Fire giants are immune to all fire-based attacks.

Frost giants have pale, almost white skin. A frost giant's hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes usually match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts, along with any jewelry they own. Frost giant warriors add chain shirts and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers.

An adult male is about 15 feet tall and weighs about 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical with males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old.

Frost giants are, first and foremost, cunning. They dislike the smaller races as much as any giant, but rather than attacking outright they will try to use their advantages to convince those weaker than them to submit. If faced with a stronger force, frost giants will parley or withdraw if possible, attacking only if victory seems assured.

A frost giant can throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 damage. Frost giants are immune to all ice or cold-based attacks.

The smallest of giants, adult hill giants stand between ten and twelve feet in height and weigh about 1,100 pounds. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old. Skin color among hill giants ranges from light tan to deep ruddy brown. They have brown or black hair and eyes the same color. They wear layers of crudely prepared hides, which they seldom wash or repair, preferring to simply add more hides as the old ones wear out.

Whether attacking with a weapon or st, hill giants deal 2d8 damage. Hill giants are brutish and aggressive. They are sometimes found leading groups of ogres or bugbears. Hill giants often keep **dire wolves** as pets.

Mountain giants are the largest of all giants, with adult
males averaging 24 feet in height and weighing around
16,000 pounds. Females are slightly smaller, standing
22 feet tall on the average and weighing around 14,000
pounds. They look very much like enormous, thickly
built hill giants, and among humans they are often seen
as little more than that. This is underselling the
mountain giants, however, for though their crafting is
primitive they have an intricately detailed social
structure.

Mountain giants live in clans, led by the oldest male and
female (or by their oldest offspring if the elders choose
to delegate leadership due to advanced age). Each clan
rules over and controls a group of 1d6 mountain peaks,
generally spanning an area with a 5-6 mile diameter.
They prefer peaks connected by high ridges so that
they do not have to descend too far when walking their
territory. Clan members who are mated establish
households within the territory; unmarried members
typically live with their parents until they are wed. The
"lair" encounter figures above are for a single
household, but if one household is attacked and the
attackers subsequently retreat, upon their return they
will usually find much of the rest of the clan waiting for
them in ambush.

They wear armor made of wood held together with
heavy rope, and wield giant clubs or staves carved from
fully grown trees harvested from the lower reaches of
their territory. If they live near storm giants, they may
trade for better weapons (the second damage rating
given above) but usually cannot afford storm giant
armor.

A mountain giant can throw large stones up to 240' for
4d6 points of damage each

Stone giants are not the largest of giants, but with an
average adult standing 12 feet tall and weighing roughly
1,500 pounds they are still formidable. There is no
substantial difference in height between males and
females. They usually dress in heavy leather clothing
with sections having been boiled to stiffen them; these
outfits serve as armor and give them the first AC above.
Stone giants are reclusive, but they will defend their
territory (typically in rocky mountainous terrain) against
any who trespass therein.

A stone giant can throw large stones up to 300' for 3d6
points of damage. They will fight in groups to defend
their territory but use only simple, basic tactics and
strategy.

Adult storm giants are about 21 feet tall and weigh about 12,000 pounds. They can live to be 600 years old. Most storm giants have pale skin and dark hair. Very rarely, storm giants have violet skin. Violet-skinned storm giants have deep violet or blue-black hair with silvery gray or purple eyes.

Storm giants generally dress in short, loose tunic belted at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and a headband. They wear a few pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, anklets (favored by barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. They live quiet, reflective lives and spend their time musing about the world, composing and playing music, and tilling their land or gathering food.

Storm giants prefer to attack first with their **lightning bolts** (which work just as the spell does, and can be used once per five rounds; a save vs. Spells reduces damage to half). Also, 10% of storm giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 12 (2d6). In battle, they wear well-crafted and well-cared-for plate mail.

Unlike most other giants, storm giants have been known to befriend humans, elves, or dwarves.

Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose tribes. Most gnolls have dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. An adult male gnoll is about 7½ feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.

Gnolls are nocturnal, and have Darkvision with a 30' range. They are cruel carnivores, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. They show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader.

One out of every six gnolls will be a hardened warrior of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. Gnolls gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by such a warrior. In lairs of 12 or greater, there will be a pack leader of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP) having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, gnolls never fail a morale check as long as the pack leader is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present, and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hardened warrior statistically, and in addition has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular gnoll, and has Magic-User abilities of level 1d4.

Gnomes stand 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Males usually wear short, carefully trimmed beards.

Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years. They have Darkvision with a 30' range. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20% chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.

Gnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure.

Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the statistics above are for such. In the lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2 on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics and Magic-Users are equivalent to regular gnomish warriors statistically.

Goblins are small, wicked humanoids that favor ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge they can devise. An adult goblin stands 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Its eyes are usually bright and crafty-looking, varying in color from red to yellow. A goblin's skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red; usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color. Goblins wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward drab, soiled-looking colors. They have Darkvision with a 30' range.

The statistics given above are for a standard Goblin in leather armor with a shield; they have a natural Movement rate of 30' and a natural Armor Class of 11.

Some goblins ride **dire wolves** into combat, and large groups of goblins will often employ them to track and attack their foes.

One out of every eight goblins will be a warrior of 3-3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Goblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In a lair or other settlement, one out of every fifteen will be a chieftain of 5-5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and movement of 10' that gains a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs or settlements of 30 or more goblins, there will be a goblin king of 7-7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 16 (11), wearing chainmail and carrying a shield, with a movement of 10', and having a +1 bonus to damage. Goblins have a +2 bonus to morale while their king is present (this is not cumulative with the bonus given by a warrior leader). In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a goblin king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular goblin statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Golem*" >

## Golem*

Golems are a kind of construct, a creature created from
non-living matter and animated by application of magic.
The powers required to animate a golem are
prodigious, and involve summoning, capturing, and
binding an elemental spirit to the constructed body.
This process also binds the golem to the will of its
creator.

They are mindless, and thus immune to magics
affecting the mind such as sleep, charm, hold, and any
form of mind reading or telepathy. They must be
given explicit, detailed instructions verbally, and the
controller must usually be within 60 feet of the golem to
do so. If not actively being commanded, a golem will
follow the last instructions given to it until the controller
returns. If such a golem is attacked, it will fight in its
own defense but will usually not pursue the attackers if
they flee. The controller can order the golem to follow
the commands of another, but can always resume
control if desired (i.e. the controller's commands always
take precedence).

Employing a golem in combat is tricky, for once one
attacks an opponent there is a cumulative 1% chance
each round (so 1% the first round, 2% the second, 3%
the third, and so on) that the golem will stop following
commands and become berserk. Once this happens
the golem will attack any creature in range, choosing
targets randomly when there are more than one. If all
targets are killed or driven away the golem will move
on, looking for more creatures to kill and breaking
down any barrier that stands in its way if it is at all
possible.

The berserk chance for a golem that is still under
control is reset to 0% only when the golem is inactive,
neither attacking nor being attacked, for one full round.

The creator of the golem (but not any other person
who might have been delegated control) may try to
calm the golem, speaking firmly to it to convince it to
stop. The creator needs to succeed at a saving throw
vs. Spells to do this, after spending a round talking to
the golem. If this roll fails the golem turns its attention
to the creator and pursues them with single-minded
hatred.

If a berserk golem is unable to attack anyone for 5
rounds it resumes its inactive state, and the controller
can again give it commands. If it begins to pursue its
creator, though, it will never stop no matter how long it
takes, and must normally be trapped or destroyed to
stop it. It has no special way to find the creator,
however, and will become inactive if it loses sight of the
creator for a minimum of 1 day. If the golem is
successfully calmed, it can be given commands again
on the very next round of combat.

As their bodies are made of non-living matter, golems
can only be hit by magical weapons. Conversely, they
are less resistant to various effects due to the fact that
they are not living creatures; in general, golems save as
if they were Fighters of ½ their hit dice in levels. For
example, a Bone Golem has 8 hit dice, but saves as a
Fighter of 4th level.

Amber golems are generally built to resemble lions or other great cats. They are able to detect invisible creatures or objects within 60', and can track with 95% accuracy through any terrain type.

style="position: absolute; top: 0.2in; left: 0in" A magical attack that deals electricity damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 full points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. For example, an amber golem hit by a **lightning bolt** for 20 points of damage is instead healed up to 6 points. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, the excess is ignored.

Bone golems are huge four-armed monsters created from the skeletons of at least two dead humanoids. Though made of bone, they are not undead and cannot be turned.

Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem can be armed with two two-handed weapons, giving 2 attacks per round and a damage figure of 1d10/1d10 or by weapon.

When a bone golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem; he or she must make a save vs. Spells to succeed at this, and at least 1 round of time is required for each check. It takes 1 round of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem's berserk chance to 0%.

These golems resemble statues made of bronze; unlike natural bronze statues, they never turn green from verdigris. A bronze golem is 10 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. A bronze golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.

The interior of a bronze golem is molten metal. Creatures hit by one in combat suffer an additional 1d10 damage from the heat (unless resistant to heat or fire). If one is hit in combat, molten metal spurts out, spraying the attacker for 2d6 damage. A save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid the metal spray.

When a bronze golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit will break free. Such a golem will go on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to cause more destruction. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem; he or she must make a save vs. Spells to succeed at this, and at least 1 round of time is required for each check. It takes 1 round of inactivity by the golem to reset the chance it will go berserk to 0%.

Clay golems are made of clay, naturally, and thus may
be any natural clay color; generally, one is will be
grayish in color, but common clay containing iron oxide
may be used which results in a red, brown, or even
orange clay golem. They are usually unclad, but some
golem-makers choose to put a leather belt, girdle, or
apron on their creation. A clay golem weighs about
600 pounds.

Wounds inflicted by a clay golem do not heal normally;
worse, magical healing cures only 1 point per die rolled
(but add all bonuses normally).

Flesh golems are horrible creations made of body parts
from deceased humanoids (including all character races
as well as humanoid monsters), crudely stitched
together and animated by magic. A flesh golem is 8
feet tall and weighs about 450 pounds.

A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a
flesh golem (as the [slow](allSpells.qmd#haste) spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no
saving throw. Attacks using lightning or electricity heal
1 point of damage per every 3 points the attack would
normally inflict, rounded down; further, such an attack
breaks any ongoing slow effect on the golem. As usual,
healing will not increase the monster above its normal
hit points. For example, a flesh golem hit by a
[lightning bolt](allSpells.qmd#lightning-bolt) which should deal 14 points of damage
instead receives up to 4 points of healing.

This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below), although it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a thick, solid foundation.

Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which fills a 10-foot cube and persists for 1 round. Those within the area of effect must save vs. Dragon Breath or die. This ability can be used up to 3 times per day.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron golem (as the [slow](allSpells.qmd#haste) spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 full points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, the excess is ignored. For example, an iron golem hit by a fireball gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 19 points. An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster, suffering 2d6 points of damage for each hit (with no saving throw normally allowed).

This golem has a humanoid body made from stone. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its body is frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs.

Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful and difficult to harm. A stone golem can use a [slow](allSpells.qmd#haste) effect, as the spell, once every other round; a save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration of 2d6 rounds.

A [stone to flesh](allSpells.qmd#flesh-to-stone) spell may be used to weaken the monster. The spell does not actually change the golem's structure, but for one full round after being affected, the golem is vulnerable to normal weapons. The stone golem is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist this effect.

Wood golems are small constructs, not more than 4' in height, and are crudely made. Being made of wood makes them vulnerable to fire-based attacks; thus, wood golems suffer one extra point of damage per die from fire; any saving throws against such effects are at a penalty of -2. They move stiffly, suffering a -1 penalty to Initiative.

Gorgons are magical monsters resembling cattle made
of iron. Their breath can turn living creatures to stone;
it covers an area 60' long by 10' wide, and can be used
as many times per day as the monster has hit dice, but
no more often than every other round. A save vs.
Petrify is allowed to resist.

An adult male gorgon weights up to 4,500 pounds and
can be as much as 7 feet tall at the shoulder and up to
9 feet long. Females (cows) will be a bit smaller,
perhaps no more than 6 feet at the shoulder and 8 feet
long with a weight of around 4,000 pounds. However,
their combat statistics are much the same as the males.
Any group of more than one gorgon will consist of one
bull with the rest being cows

Griffons are large carnivorous creatures resembling lions with the head, foreclaws and wings of eagles. From nose to tail, an adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad, golden wings emerge from the creature's back and span 25 feet or more. An adult griffon weighs about 500 pounds.

Griffons nest on high mountaintops, soaring down to feed on horses, the beast's preferred prey. They hunt and travel in ocks. A Griffon will attack a horse over anything else, diving low to swipe with their claws. They are not above retreating and coming back later, when there may be less of a defense mounted.

Griffons can be trained as mounts if raised in captivity, but even in this case they may try to attack horses if any come within about 120'. Roll a morale check in this case; if the check is failed, the griffon will try to attack immediately. A light load for a griffon is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Hangman trees are horrible, semi-animate creatures that fertilize themselves with dead bodies. A hangman tree has four animated limbs that can wrap around the necks of living creatures that pass beneath, strangling for 1d6 points of damage per round. These limbs are arranged evenly around the tree in most cases, and generally no more than one limb can attack any single creature at a time.

The roots of this tree are also animated; they do not attack, but they do pull dead bodies below the surface of the ground for "digestion."

A harpy looks like a giant vulture bearing the torso and face of a human female. They are able to attack with their claws as well as with normal weapons, but their most insidious ability is their song. When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than harpies) within a 300' radius must succeed on a save vs. Spells or become **charmed**. The same harpy's song cannot affect a creature that successfully saves again for 24 hours. A charmed victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area (through ame, off a cliff, or the like), that creature is allowed a second saving throw to resist the charm. Charmed creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within reach of the harpy offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as the harpy sings, and for one round thereafter.

Normal hawks (or falcons) are raptors, predatory birds
that typically subsist on small snakes and other vermin.
Most have wingspans of less than 5 feet and a body
length of no more than 2 feet.

Giant hawks are 4 to 6 feet long, with wingspans of 12

Hellhounds are canine creatures sheathed in hellish flame. A typical hell hound stands 4½ feet high at the shoulder and weighs 120 pounds. They are native to another plane where they hunt in packs; sometimes powerful wizards or evil priests summon them for use as watchdogs. In addition to biting, each hellhound may breathe fire a number of times per day equal to its hit dice. In combat, one-third of the time (1-2 on 1d6) a hellhound will choose to breathe fire; otherwise it will attempt to bite. Roll each round to determine which attack form will be used.

A hellhound's breath weapon is a cone of flame 10' wide at the far end which is 10' long for those with 3 or 4 hit dice, 20' long for those with 5 or 6 hit dice, and 30' long for the largest hellhounds. This breath weapon does 1d6 points of damage per each hit die of the hellhound to all within the area of effect; a successful saving throw vs. Dragon Breath reduces damage to half normal.

Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice each has. If generating a group randomly, roll 1d6+1 for the hit dice of each, reading a total of 2 as 3. A hellhound has an Armor Class equal to 11 plus its hit dice.

Hippogriffs resemble large fying horses with the forefront of a bird of prey. A typical hippogriff is 9 feet long, has a wingspan of 20 feet, and weighs 1,000 pounds.

A hippogriff avoids the territories and civilizations of other creatures, dwelling in extreme altitudes. **Griffons** sometimes prey upon them, and hippogriffs will generally attack griffons on sight if they have a numerical advantage.

Hippogriffs are omnivorous, entering combat only as defense, save for those times a griffon is met. They are prized as flying mounts since, unlike griffons, they are relatively safe around horses; note that it is still necessary to raise one in captivity in order to use it as a mount. A light load for a hippogriff is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Hobgoblins are larger cousins of goblins, being about the same size as humans. Their hair color ranges from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. They have dark orange or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblins' eyes are yellowish or dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often blood red with black-tinted leather. Their weaponry is kept polished and in good repair. They wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields for armor. As with most goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.

Hobgoblins are cruel and calculating warriors, always looking to exploit those weaker than themselves. They have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics and are capable of carrying out sophisticated battle plans. Under the leadership of a skilled strategist or tactician, their discipline can prove a deciding factor. Hobgoblins hate elves and attack them first in preference over other opponents.

One out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Regular hobgoblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20', having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), adding a shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11) (movement is still 20') having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular hobgoblin, but has Magic-User abilities of level 1d6.

Hydras are reptile-like monsters with multiple heads. They are gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan underbelly. The eyes are amber and the teeth are yellow-white. Hydras are about 20 feet long and weigh about 4,000 pounds. They are bad-tempered and territorial, but not particularly cunning.

A hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however, most who fight them choose to strike at their heads. If a character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a particular head, and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be able to attack anymore. Such damage also applies to the monster's total hit points, of course.

Some hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a swimming rate rather than walking in this case. A very few hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit a flame 10' wide and 20' long one time per head per day. This attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it is available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs. Dragon Breath reducing the amount by half.

Hyenas are doglike carnivores who exhibit some of the behaviors of canines but are not related. They not only hunt but also scavenge and steal meals. A hungry hyena will chew on anything that is even remotely tainted by blood, meat or other food traces. They will mostly be found in the same savanna-like environments where lions and zebras may be found. They can live in clans of up to a hundred individuals, though smaller groups are more common. They are among the favorite pets of gnolls, who may take them into regions where they are not normally found.

These ancient four legged predators are named for their tooth shape, and while they are not technically prehistoric hyenas, the statistics work for the giant prehistoric varieties of hyenas as well. Many varieties of hyenodons were smallish, sometimes no bigger than a common hyena, and the statistics for standard hyenas may be used for them. The above statistics are for the larger types of Hyenodons or giant varieties of Hyena. A notable feature is that their massively built skull features a long jaw (similar to that of a crocodile) full of teeth, with four great fangs.

| Morale: | 11 |

| XP: | 100 - 280 |

An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit. In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to three 10' cubes, though it is possible for a swarm to become more compact in order to move through a small doorway or narrow corridor. If the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10' squares and the flying movement above is ignored.

Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm suffers 1d3 points of damage each round. Damage rolls are doubled if the victim is unarmored (for creatures which do not wear armor, any creature having less than Armor Class 15 is considered unarmored).

Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds if the character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to "ward off" the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in this case also damage is reduced to 1 point per round. If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round. Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be affected by a **sleep** spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from the victim(s) due to smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more round.

Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon them to perform specific tasks.

A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until the task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert its instructions accordingly.

Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A [detect invisible](allSpells.qmd#detect-invisible) spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud. Don't forget to apply the standard penalty of -4 on the attack die when an invisible stalker is attacked by a creature which is unable to see it.

| XP:             | 175             |

An ironbane resembles a large armadillo in its overall
body plan, but has an anteater-like snout with a long
flicking tongue, and long, strangely hare-like back legs
which allow it to hop from place to place. When
attacking or pursuing, the ironbane stands up on its
hind legs, but when resting or moving slowly it folds
them and walks on all four feet.

Like the more common rust monster (as found on page
138), the touch of any part of an ironbane's body
transforms metal objects into rust (or verdigris, or other
oxides as appropriate). Non-magical metal attacked by
an ironbane, or that touches the monster (such as a
sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A non-
magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does
half damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons
or armor lose one "plus" each time they make contact
with the ironbane; this loss is permanent.

The metal oxides created by this monster are its food;
thus, a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path
may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored
characters. Use a morale check to determine this.

Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of
no interest to an ironbane and will be ignored. Silver
and copper on the other hand are candy for this
creature and one will pursue the tastiest-smelling
adventurer in any party.

These great cats are about 8 to 9 feet long (from nose to tail-tip) and weigh about 165 pounds. Unlike other great cats, they enjoy swimming and often hunt near rivers or lakes. Jaguars kill with their powerful bite, preferring to deliver a fatal wound to the skull of their prey.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Jelly">

## Jelly

Jellies are strange creatures made of amorphous
protoplasm. They are similar to tiny single-celled
creatures such as a few wizards may have studied using
magic, but far larger. Jellies are always completely non-
intelligent, and are thus immune to **sleep** or **charm**
magic as well as any form or **mind reading** or
telepathy. Generally they also do not check morale,
but simply move toward any potential meal and attack
automatically.

Black jellies are amorphous creatures that live only to
eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the
world, scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search
of organic matter, living or dead. They attack any
creatures they encounter, lashing out with pseudopods
or simply engulfing opponents with their bodies, which
secrete acids that help them catch and digest their prey.

If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with
lightning or electricity, a black jelly suffers no injury, but
will be split into two jellies; the GM should divide the
original creature's hit dice between the two however
they see fit, with the limitation that neither pudding may
have less than two hit dice. A two hit die black jelly is
simply unharmed by such attacks, but cannot be split
further.

Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black jelly, but
such an attack will paralyze the jelly for one round per
die of damage the attack would normally cause. Other
attack forms will affect a black jelly normally; the
preferred method of killing one usually involves fire.

The typical black jelly measures 10 feet across and 2
feet thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black
jellies of smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly as
a result of the splitting described above.

The glass jelly travels slowly along dungeon corridors
and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash.
Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside
the jelly’s body. Glass jellies are huge, averaging 1,000
cubic feet and weighing as much as 20,000 pounds.
The body of a glass jelly is more viscous than that of
other jellies, and it tends to take on the shape of its
surroundings such that one in a dungeon with 10' wide
corridors might have a shape similar to that of a cube,
while one living in round sewer drains under a city
would have a cylindrical or half-cylindrical shape.

If a glass jelly encounters a narrow place (a doorway,
for example) it will need 2d4 rounds to push through
the constriction and will have assumed a new shape
after doing so; such a new shape will persist for twice as
long as it took to pass the constriction before the
monster begins to flow into a shape that fills the
available space again.

Glass jellies move quietly, making a faint sucking or
slurping sound if anyone thinks to listen. Combined
with their transparency, they are able to surprise prey
on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6. Worse, any living creature hit
by a glass jelly must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed
for 2d4 turns in addition to suffering damage from its
acid secretions.

Any treasure indicated will be visible inside the creature,
which must be slain if the treasure is to be recovered.

Gray jellies are amorphous creatures that live only to
eat. They inhabit underground areas, scouring caverns,
ruins, and dungeons in search of organic matter, living
or dead. Average individuals will be up to 10 feet in
diameter, about 6 inches thick (high), and weigh up to
2,500 pounds.

The acid secretions of the gray jelly can dissolve most
organic matter and most metals; stone and glass are not
affected, however. After a successful hit, the jelly will
stick to the creature attacked, dealing 2d8 damage per
round automatically. Normal (non-magical) armor or
clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately.
Any non-magical weapon made of metal or wood
which hits a gray jelly will be similarly destroyed.
Magical weapons, armor, and clothing are allowed a
saving throw (use the wearer's save vs. Death Ray,
adding any magical "plus" value to the roll if applicable).

Green jelly devours flesh and organic materials on
contact and is even capable of dissolving metal given
enough time. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to
walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it
consumes organic matter. It drops from walls and
ceilings when it detects movement (and possible food)
below. Green jelly cannot grow in sunlight; even the
indirect sunlight of a dense forest will stunt it and
prevent it from spreading, and direct sunlight will kill it
outright within a turn.

On the first round of contact, the jelly can be scraped
off a creature (most likely destroying the scraping
device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut
away (dealing the same damage to both the victim and
the jelly). A cure disease spell will destroy a patch of
green jelly. It does not harm stone or enchanted metal,
but can dissolve normal metal or enchanted wood in a
turn and normal wood in 2d4 rounds.

If not destroyed or scraped off within 6+1d4 rounds,
the victim will be completely transformed into more
green jelly; such a character or creature cannot be
retrieved by any magic short of a wish.

Ochre jellies are yellowish-brown amorphous monsters.
Average individuals will be up to 10 feet in diameter,
about 6 inches thick (high), and weigh up to 2,500
pounds.

Ochre jellies can only be hit (damaged) by fire or cold.
Attacks with weapons or electricity/lightning cause the

Kobolds are small, dog-faced reptilian humanoids. A kobold is 2 to 2½ feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas. They aim to drive enemies into the traps, where other kobolds wait to pour flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin onto them. Kobolds have Darkvision with a range of 60', and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of **light** spells. Kobolds typically wear leather armor in battle.

One out of every six kobolds will be a warrior of 1 Hit Dice (25 XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP) with an Armor Class of 14 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP) who wears chain mail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 10', and who has a +1 bonus to damage. In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular kobold statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

Kobolds are cunning foes. They see all larger races as enemies, and are thus likely to be hostile when encountered. However, they are naturally cowardly, and prefer to avoid combat, leading enemies into ambushes or traps rather than facing them directly. Sometimes kobold tribes build and inhabit extensive dungeon areas filled with deadly traps which only they know how to avoid.

Giant leeches are slimy, segmented wormlike creatures which live in water. Salt or fresh, clean or stagnant, there are giant leech varieties for all wet environments. However, only a true leech expert can tell the various types apart. An average giant leech will be 4 to 6 feet long.

Once a giant leech hits in combat, it attaches to the victim and sucks blood, causing an additional 1d6 damage each round until the victim or the leech is dead. There is no way to remove the leech other than to kill it.

Leopards are large cats that are 7 to 8 feet long
including tail, and weigh about 175 lb. These cats have
four black spots that form a large circle (rosette). The
center of the circle and around the rosette spots range
from yellow tan to white on the underside. An all-black
leopard is called a Panther. The tail has a white tip.
They don’t like to swim as much as jaguars, preferring
instead to climb trees. A leopard will drag prey into a

The lion is a large cat found in grasslands and
savannas. They have muscular, broad-chested bodies,
short, rounded heads, round ears, and a hairy tuft at
the end of its tail. Adult male lions are larger than
females, and in most varieties have a prominent mane.
They live in social groups called prides consisting of a
few adult males, several related females, and their cubs.

Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying
mostly on large ungulates; any hunting group of 1 or 2
is 80% likely to be females, and any group of 3 or more
almost certainly are. Sometimes male lions are rogues,
living outside a pride, and in those cases they may hunt
as individuals or in pairs.

Lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on
humans. Injured or obviously vulnerable humans may
be too much of a temptation though.

## Living Statue

Living statues are magically animated. They are true automatons, unlike golems, which are animated by elemental spirits. While this means that living statues have no chance of going "berserk," it also means that they may only perform simple programmed activities. They may not be commanded in any meaningful fashion. They make very effective guards for tombs, treasure rooms, and similar places.

Living statues can be crafted to resemble any sort of living creature, but most commonly are made to look like humans or demi-humans.

If struck by a non-magical metal (even partially metal) weapon, the weapon may become stuck in the monster. If this happens, it cannot be removed until the statue is "killed." The wielder is allowed a save vs. Spells to avoid this.

Giant draco lizards are able to extend their ribs and connected skin to form a sort of wing, allowing them to fly for short distances (no more than three rounds, and ascending is impossible). An average giant draco lizard is 8' long, including its nearly 3' long tail. They are fierce predators.

Giant gecko lizards range from 4' to 6' in length, and are generally green in color, though grey or white versions can be found underground. They can climb walls and even walk across ceilings at full movement rate due to their specialized toe pads. They are carnivores, typically attacking weaker prey from above.

Giant horned chameleons average 8' to 10' in length. They are typically green, but can change color to blend into their surroundings, allowing them to surprise prey on 1-4 on 1d6. Giant horned chameleon have very long tongues, able to spring out up to 20' forward; the sticky muscular ball on the end grabs on to the chameleon's prey, and the chameleon then drags the prey to its mouth, doing bite damage automatically on the following round (and all subsequent rounds, until the chameleon is killed or fails a morale check, or until the prey is dead).

The horns of the giant horned chameleon are used only in mating rituals, not in combat.

Giant tuataras are large, being 10' to 12' long, and heavily built. They are predators with a powerful shearing bite. Giant tuataras are more resistant to cold than most lizards, and are thus sometimes found hunting deep underground. They are also known to hibernate in cold weather.

Monitor lizards are generally dark in color, but often
have bright, colorful, lace-like patterns covering their
skin. A monitor may rise up onto its hind legs to run at
a rate of 60 feet per round; such movement must be in
a straight line, ending with the creature on all fours
again. However, unlike a "double move" running
movement, the monitor may still attack after moving. 

Large monitor lizards range from 4 to 7 feet in length,
and include such creatures as the so-called Komodo
Dragon. Their venom is slow; those who are bitten
must save vs. Poison at +2, with failure resulting in the
victim suffering 1d6 points of damage each turn for 2d4
turns.

Huge monitors range from 8 to 11 feet in length. Their
venom works faster than that of their smaller brethren;
those bitten must save vs. Poison as +2 or suffer 1d6
points of damage each round for 2d4 rounds.

Giant monitor lizards range from 12 to 15 feet in length.
Those bitten by a giant monitor must save vs. Poison at
+2 or die.

All monitors are carnivores who hunt by running down
their prey, and anything smaller than a monitor is
considered prey.

**Common lizard men** are tall, generally 6 to 7 feet tall
at adulthood and weighing up to 250 pounds. Males
and females are basically the same size, and it is quite
difficult for other races to tell them apart. Due to their
great Strength they always receive a +1 to damage
done with melee weapons. They wear leather armor
and carry shields in battle.

Lizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their
breath for an extended period of time (up to a full turn).
They cannot swim while wearing armor; however, they
often hide in the water even while armored, standing
on the bottom with just nose and eyes exposed (similar
to a crocodile). When they are able to employ this
maneuver, lizard men surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.

Lizard men are largely indifferent to other races, being
primarily interested in their own survival. If aroused,
however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple but
sound tactics.

**Subterranean lizard men**, also called troglodytes, are
superficially very similar to the common variety. Their
skin is paler, and their eyes are red and seem to glow in
low light conditions. Individuals are shorter than the
common variety, standing just 5 to 6 feet tall, due in
part to their somewhat "hunched" stance. They weigh
about as much as the common type.

These monsters can change color at will, allowing them
to blend into underground environments so well that
they gain surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6.
Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any
surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills.

Subterranean lizard men secrete a smelly oil that keeps
their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of
course, all the standard character races) find the scent
repulsive, and those within 10 feet of one must make a
saving throw versus poison. Those failing the save
suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain
within 10 feet of the creature. Getting out of range
negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates
the penalty without an additional saving throw. The
results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after
which a new save must be rolled.

<div class="monster" data-tag="Lycanthrope*" >

## Lycanthrope*

Lycanthropes are humans who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any other human, though those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.

Lycanthropy is spread like a disease. Any human who loses half or more of his or her hit points due to lycanthrope bite and/or claw attacks will subsequently contract the same form of lycanthropy in 3d6 days. For demi-humans and humanoids, contracting the disease is fatal in the same time period. A **cure disease** cast before the onset is complete will stop the progress of the disease, but once the time has elapsed, the transformation is permanent.

When first infected, most lycanthropes cannot control
their changes and will transform when stressed or under
some other type-specific circumstances. After around
two to three years, they gain the ability to change at
will, and may attempt to resist involuntary
transformation by means of a saving throw vs.
Paralysis.

In animal form, lycanthropes may be hit only by silver or magical weapons.

Werebears are humans that can transform into large bears. When in human form, they typically appear as well-muscled, imposing figures, with an abundance of thick hair. Werebears typically dwell in deep forests, far from civilization. They are distrustful of those that they do not know, but will ferociously defend those that they have befriended.

Wereboars gain full control of their transformations
quickly, needing only about a year to achieve mastery.
They have just two forms, that of a human and that of a
particularly large wild boar or sow.

In human form they tend to have "piggish" features
such as gluttony and cunning, as well as an often strong
physical resemblance to swine. Wereboars usually
dislike both hard work and responsibility, but they are
bullies who enjoy being in charge. They are easily
bored with mundane things but are excited by violence
(whether witnessing it or participating in it).

A wererat in human form tends to be a thin, wiry individual of shorter than average height, with eyes constantly darting around. A wererat's nose and mouth may twitch if he or she is excited. Males often wear thin, ragged mustaches.

In addition to assuming the form of a giant rat, wererats can assume an intermediate form (a "ratman"). The ratman form shares the animal form's immunity to normal weapons, and can deliver an identical bite, but in this form the wererat may use a normal weapon instead of biting. Note that the wererat in ratman form cannot bite and use a weapon in the same round.

Unlike most lycanthropes, wererats prefer to inhabit civilized areas, particularly cities. They frequently lair in sewers or other underground areas, coming out by night to steal from or kill city folk.

Weretigers are humans that can transform into tigers. In human form, they tend to be tall, trim, and very agile. They tend to live and hunt close to human settlements, and are excellent trackers (5 in 6 chance to track prey in either form). Weretigers will typically only attack if provoked. They are capricious and arbitrary to
deal with unless whatever offer is made to them is very attractive to them.

Werewolves may be found anywhere humans are
found. They are ferocious predators, equally willing to
eat animal or human flesh. Unlike most lycanthropes,
werewolves have no distinguishing features in human
form, making them very hard indeed to identify.

Though they usually have only the usual human and
animal forms, there are rumors of some who are also
able to assume a wolfman form. In this form they may
choose to either bite or use a weapon, and may change
back and forth each round. As with the animal form,
the wolfman form is hit only by silver or magical
weapons.

Manticores look like an overgrown lion with thick leathery wings and an ugly humanoid face, often like that of a human or bearded dwarf. Their tail ends in an assortment of spikes, which the beast may fire as projectiles; a maximum of 24 are available, and the manticore regrows 1d6 per day. A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Manticores are vicious predators, having a preference for human flesh. They will use their ranged attacks to "soften up" potential prey before closing to melee.

**Mammoths** are huge, shaggy prehistoric relatives of
the elephant. Though found in a variety of climates,
they are most common in colder territories.

Like elephants, mammoths have five distinct attack
modes (two tusks, a trunk grab, and two tramples with
the front feet), but a single individual can apply no
more than two of these attacks to any single opponent
of small or medium size; large opponents may be
targeted by three of these attacks in a round. However,
one can attack multiple opponents in its immediate area
at the same time.

A light load for a mammoth is 8,500 pounds; a heavy
load, up to 17,000 pounds.

A mammoth has no treasure as such, but its tusks are
worth 2d6 x 100 gp.

**Mastodons** are a related species found in more
temperate climates. These prehistoric relatives of the
elephant are intelligent and able to communicate with
each other in a rudimentary way. They are more
aggressive than the common elephant and will attack
any creature they see as a threat.

They have the same basic attack modes as mammoths,
with the same limitations as given above.

A light load for a mastodon is 8,000 pounds; a heavy
load, up to 16,000 pounds.

A mastodon has no treasure as such, but its tusks are
worth 1d10 x 100 gp.

A medusa appears to be a human female with vipers growing from her head instead of hair. The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it unless a save vs. Petrification is made. In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC. It is safe to view a medusa's reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrification itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.

Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs. Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).

A medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human.

Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain. They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can without being discovered.

Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of dolphins. Also called "sirens," mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or other men found near the sea. They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.

A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid's temperament.

Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.

Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.

Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a pod.

One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.

A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only in groups of 1 or 2.

Mermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some Clerical abilities.

Minotaurs are huge bull-headed humanoid monsters. A minotaur stands more than 7 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds. Most minotaurs are very aggressive, and fly into a murderous rage if provoked or hungry. Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. They never become lost, and can track enemies with 85% accuracy. They gain +2 to damage when using melee weapons due to their great Strength. Minotaurs often wear toughened hides for armor.

Mummies are **undead** monsters, linen-wrapped preserved corpses animated through the auspices of dark desert gods best forgotten. Most mummies are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.

As they are undead, mummies are immune to **sleep**, **charm** and **hold** magic. They can only be injured by spells, fire, or magical weapons; furthermore, magic weapons do only half damage, while any sort of fire-based attack does double damage. Those injured by mummy attacks will contract **mummy rot**, a disease that prevents normal or magical healing; a **cure disease** spell must be applied to the victim before he or she may again regain hit points.

Nixies are small water fairies. As far as anyone knows, all nixies are female. Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. They often twine shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed. Nixies prefer not to leave their lakes. A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45 pounds.

Ten or more nixies can work together to cast a powerful charm (similar to **charm person**). The charm lasts one year (unless dispelled). A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. Each nixie can cast **water breathing** once per day, with a duration of one day. Finally, a group of nixies will often have a school of giant bass living nearby who can be called to their aid (see **Fish, Giant Bass** for details).

Nixies are fey creatures, and thus unpredictable. However, they are rarely malicious, attacking only when they feel threatened.

The giant octopus is, obviously, an enormous version of
the normal creature. They are physically powerful as
well as being clever, which makes them a serious threat
to seagoing vessels.

In order to bite a creature, the giant octopus must hit
with at least two tentacles first. Further, any time a
giant octopus hits with at least one tentacle per each
100 pounds of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it;
unless the victim can find a way to resist (using
whatever method the player might think of and
whatever rolls the GM may choose), they will be pulled
into the water and thus be in danger of drowning.

Don't forget to account for the weight of armor worn!
If a giant octopus fails a morale check, it will squirt out a
cloud of black "ink" 40' in diameter and then jet away at
twice normal speed for 2d6 rounds. Any characters
being held will normally be released at this point.

Ogres appear as large, very ugly humans. Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing consists of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally repellent odor. Ogres are brutish and aggressive, but inherently lazy. They employ direct attacks in combat, typically using large clubs, axes, or pole arms, generally causing 2d6 damage. If normal weapons are employed, an ogre has a +3 bonus to damage due to strength. If an ogre fights bare-handed, it does 1d8 subduing damage per hit.

One out of every six ogres will be a pack leader of 6+1 Hit Dice (500 XP). Ogres gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a pack leader. In ogre lairs of 10 or greater, there will also be an ogre bully of 8+2 Hit Dice (875 XP), with an Armor Class of 17 (13) (movement 20') and having a +4 bonus to damage due to strength. Ogre bullies generally wire together pieces of chainmail to wear over their hides. Ogres gain +2 to morale so long as the ogre bully is present (and alive).

Orcs are grotesque humanoids bent on war and domination. They have lupine ears, reddish eyes, truncated, upturned noses, and black hair (but very little body hair). An adult male orc is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds; females are slightly smaller. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. They utilize all manner of weapons and armor scavenged from battlefields.

Orcs have Darkvision to a range of 60'. They suffer a -1 attack penalty in bright sunlight or within the radius of a spell causing magical light. They speak their own rough and simple language, but many also speak some common or goblin.

One out of every eight orcs will be a warrior of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP). Orcs gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In orc lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11), a movement 20', and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or more, there will be an orc king of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with an Armor Class of 16 (11), in chainmail with a shield, movement 20', and having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, orcs never fail a morale check as long as the orc king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present. A shaman is equivalent to a warrior orc statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

These birds are sometimes raised (or hunted) as food.

Owls are birds of prey with large eyes and the ability to
fly without making a sound. They are nocturnal, and
have superior Darkvision of 120' range. An owl will
stand about 6 to 18 inches tall with a wingspan of 20
inches. An owl’s vision is very sharp and comparable
to that of a falcon. It can also hear very well, even to
the point that a rodent creeping through grass will draw
attention. The owl will fly over a field and listen and
watch for movement and then dive for a kill with its
talons.

Owlbear are among the most feared of the nocturnal
forest dwelling monsters, and for good reason for they
are always hungry and always aggressive. They appear
to be bears with owlish faces, including a large, sharp
beak. They fight much as do bears, and as with normal
bears an owlbear must hit with both claws in order to
do the listed "hug" damage.

These monsters are known to hunt by day when
particularly hungry, but they prefer to live nocturnally.
They have superior Darkvision with a range of 120 feet,
without the usual penalties for being in full sunlight.
They are also very quiet, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 in
their native territory.

The pegasus is the winged horse of legend. They are

but they are shy creatures who live in the highest
mountains, making them rare indeed in captivity.

An average female pegasus stands 5 feet high at the
shoulder, weighs 1,200 pounds, and has a wingspan of
20 feet; males are somewhat larger, averaging 6 feet in
height and weighing 1,400 pounds, with a wingspan of

Pixies are winged fairies often found in forested areas.
Like sprites, pixies love beauty. They dress in bright
colors and favor clothing with flourishes like feathered
caps, curly-tipped shoes, scarves, and so on. They are
quite small, just 2½ feet in height and weighing no more
than 30 pounds. Pixies can only fly for 3 turns
maximum before requiring rest of at least one turn,
during which time the pixie may walk at normal speed
but may not fly.

A pixie can become **invisible** at will, as many times per
day as it wishes, and can attack while remaining
invisible. Anyone attacking an invisible pixie does so
with an attack penalty of -4 unless the attacker can
somehow detect invisible creatures. Pixies may
ambush their foes while invisible; if they do so, they
surprise on 1-5 on 1d6.

Purple worms are gigantic subterranean monsters; they are rarely found above ground. The body of a mature purple worm is 5-8 feet in diameter and 60-100 feet long, weighing about 40,000 pounds.

The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail; those injured by it must save vs. Poison or die. Note that the purple worm's movement is less than the monster's length, so that, if attacking from out of a tunnel, it might not be able to use the stinger for several rounds.

Any time a purple worm successfully bites a man-sized or smaller opponent with a natural roll of 19 or 20, the opponent has been swallowed, and will suffer 3d6 damage per round afterward due to being digested. A character who has been swallowed can only effectively attack with small cutting or stabbing weapons such as dagger or shortsword.

These omnivorous rodents thrive almost anywhere. Normal rats attack as a swarm; each point of damage done to the swarm reduces their numbers by one animal.

Giant rats are scavengers, but will attack to defend their nests and territories. A giant rat can grow to be up to 4 feet long and weigh over 50 pounds. A single giant rat, or a small group of up to four, will generally be shy, but larger packs attack fearlessly, biting and chewing with their sharp incisors.

Any rat bite has a 5% chance of causing a disease. A character who suffers one or more rat bites where the die roll indicates disease will sicken in 3d6 hours. The infected character will lose one point of Constitution per hour; after losing each point, the character is allowed a save vs. Death Ray (adjusted by the current Constitution bonus or penalty) to break the fever and end the disease. Any character reduced to zero Constitution is dead. See **Constitution Point Losses** in the **Encounter** section for details on regaining lost Constitution.

\* Note: The XP award for normal rats is for driving away or killing an entire pack of normal size. If the adventurers are forced to flee, the GM should award 3 XP per rat slain.

The rhagodessa is related to both spiders and
scorpions, though it is not properly either. Rhagodessas
have "pedipalps," an elongated pair of forelegs with
sticky pads on them for capturing prey.

Giant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found
in desert terrain are generally marked in yellow, red,
and brown, while those found underground may be
black or white in color (those found in the deepest
caverns are always white). Like spiders, they can climb
walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise
climb entirely upside down.

A hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck
fast and will be drawn to the rhagodessa's mouth on the
next round and automatically hit for 2d8 points of
damage; this repeats each round, so long as the victim
is held. Escaping from the sticky hold requires a
successful roll to open doors. If both legs hit, this roll
frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is
needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa
can simply attack again with the free leg on the next
round. Alternately, victims may attack with small or
medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2
is added to the attack roll if a small weapon is used. If
the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be
freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in
this case another character can help, making the roll for
the victim).

The rhagodessa seems unable to use its bite attack
against a foe it has not captured in this way, and neither
will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If
threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim
will attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace.

The rhinoceros is infamous for its bad temper and willingness to charge intruders.

The statistics presented here are based on the African black rhino, which is 6 to 14 feet long, 3 to 6 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs up to 6,000 pounds. These statistics can describe any herbivore of similar size and similar natural weapons (antlers, horns, tusks, or the like).

The woolly rhinoceros is a prehistoric beast with long fur, found in primitive "lost world" areas in colder territories. They behave much as the black rhino does.

Rocs are birds similar to eagles, but even a "normal" roc
is huge, being about 9 feet long and having a wingspan
of 24 feet. Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have
wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet
long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A
roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head
to tail. Like most birds, the males have the brighter
plumage, with females being duller in color and thus
more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be
hidden, that is).

A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a
heavy load is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest
characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc. For a
large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy
load up to 1,200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3,000
pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to
6,000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off full-
grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note
that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for
these monstrous birds.

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to
snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for
itself and its young to devour. Any successful hit with
both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results
in that creature being carried off, unless of course the
creature is too large for the roc to carry. While being
carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to
be as "fresh" as possible when given to the hatchlings
(or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary).

When rocs are encountered they are almost certainly
hunting, and will generally attack creatures of horse size
or less. If facing a large group the rocs may make
passes close overhead to scatter them first before each
chooses a single target to prey upon. Mated pairs
found in their nests will fight to the death to protect
their eggs or offspring (morale of 12 in this case).

Rock baboons are a large, particularly intelligent variety of baboon. An adult male rock baboon is 4' to 5' tall and weighs 200 to 250 pounds, with females being a bit smaller and lighter.

Rock baboons are omnivorous, but prefer meat. They are aggressive, naturally cruel creatures. They will prepare ambushes in rocky or forested terrain and attack any party they outnumber.

Rot grubs are 1-inch long vermin found in carrion, dung, and other such garbage and organic material. Their skin color is white or brown. When a living creature contacts an area (dung heap, offal, etc) infested with rot grubs, the grubs will attack if they can come in contact the victim's skin. A rot grub secretes an anesthetic when it bites and will burrow into the flesh. A burrowing grub can be noticed if the victim succeeds at a Wisdom check. If successful, the victim sees strange rippling beneath his skin. If failed, the creature does not notice the grubs. During the first two rounds, a burrowing rot grub can be killed by applying fire to the infested skin or by cutting open the infested skin with any slashing weapon. Either method deals 2d6 points of damage to the victim, but kills the grubs. After the second round, only a cure disease can kill the grubs as they burrow to the victim's heart and devour it in 1d3 turns.

A rust monster (sometimes known as a corroder or
corrosion beast) is a strange monster built like a huge
turtle, with an insectoid head sporting large feather-like
antennae and a thick tail with a hammer-like protrusion
at the tip which seems to serve no purpose whatsoever.

The touch of any part of a rust monster's body oxidizes
metal objects instantly, turning them to rust, verdigris,
or other oxides as appropriate. One attacks with its
antennae, brushing them over metal items. Non-
magical metal attacked by a rust monster, or that
touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it),
is instantly ruined. A hit with a non-magical metal
weapon inflicts half damage before the weapon is
destroyed. Magic weapons or armor permanently lose
one "plus" each time they make contact with the
monster.

The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a
substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may
cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters.
Use a morale check to determine this. Metals that do
not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to
a rust monster and will be ignored. While rust monsters
will consume oxides of silver or copper, they have a
strong preference for ferrous metals (iron or steel),
preferring them over any other metal.

Whether the rust monster is in any way related to the
rarer ironbane (as found on page 115) is unknown, but
both monsters seem to have the exact same power.

The sabre-tooth cat, or smilodon, is a prehistoric great
cat with very large canine teeth. They are more
robustly built than other great cats, with particularly
well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper
canine teeth. Sabre-tooth cats are ambush predators,
surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 in their natural environment
(forests and tall-grass prairies), where they prey
primarily upon large herbivores.

Flame salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of
Fire. They look like giant snakes, more than 12' long,
with dragon-like heads and lizard forelimbs. Their
scales are all the colors of flame, red and orange and
yellow. A flame salamander is flaming hot, and all non-
fire-resistant creatures within 20' of the monster suffer
1d8 points of damage per round from the heat. They
are immune to damage from any fire or heat attack.
Flame salamanders are intelligent; they speak the

Frost salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of
Water. They look like giant lizards with six legs. Their
scales are the colors of ice, white, pale gray and pale
blue. Frost salamanders are very cold, and all non-
cold-resistant creatures within 20' suffer 1d8 points of
damage per round from the cold. Frost salamanders
are completely immune to all types of cold-based
attacks. They are quite intelligent; all speak the
language of the Plane of Water, and many also speak
Common, Elvish, and/or Dragon.

Flame and frost salamanders hate each other, and each
type will attack the other on sight, in preference over
any other foe. If summoned by a Magic-User, a
salamander is often assigned to protect a location,
doorway, or treasure hoard; in such a case, the
salamander will attack anyone attempting to gain
unauthorized access to the protected area. Those
which arrive through natural rifts may have any goals or
motivations the GM wishes, and thus may choose to
parley, fight, or even ignore adventurers.

Lightning Salamanders come from the Elemental Plane
of Air. A lightning salamander resembles a giant snake
more than 12 feet long with two dragon-like heads (on
short but flexible necks). Its scales are all the colors of
lightning: white, blue, purple, and yellow. A lightning
salamander constantly emits little bolts of lightning; all
creatures within 20 feet of the salamander that are not
lightning-resistant suffer 1d8 points of damage per
round. A lightning salamander is immune to damage
from any type of electrical or lightning attack. It is
intelligent and can speak the language of the Plane of
Air, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or
Dragon.

Despite having two heads a lightning salamander has
only one mind; either head may speak or both may,
but it is very rare to meet a lightning salamander who
can speak different words with each head at the same
time (although those who can are known to sing duets
with themselves, which may give away one's location to
those listening).

Sand salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of
Earth. A sand salamander resembles a giant sea turtle
with six flippers and a serpentine neck and head, with
scales of varying shades of gray or brown.

The sand salamander's most feared attack is its bite, for
any living creature bitten by one must save vs. Petrify
or be turned to stone. In addition to attacking, a sand
salamander can temporarily transform any stone within
a 20 foot radius into sand. Characters in the affected
area must save vs. Paralysis each round in order to
move through the sand, and if the save is successful,
the character is still reduced to half their normal
movement. Whenever the sand salamander moves out
of range, the sand "congeals" back into stone, and any
character in the affected area must save vs. Paralysis or
become trapped. Extraction of a trapped person may
take quite a long time, chipping and hammering at the
stone to break it apart.

A sand salamander is immune to piercing attacks (such
as spears or arrows) and suffers half damage from
cutting attacks. It is intelligent and can speak the
language of the Plane of Earth; many may also know
Elvish, Common, or Dragon.

Giant scorpions are quite large, sometimes as large as a donkey. They are aggressive predators and generally attack on sight. If a claw attack hits, the giant scorpion receives a +2 attack bonus with its stinger (but two claw hits do not give a double bonus). Those hit by the stinger must save vs. Poison or die. Giant scorpions are most commonly found in desert areas or caverns.

A shadow can be difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas but stands out starkly in brightly illuminated places. They lurk in dark places, waiting for living prey to happen by. A shadow is 5 to 6 feet tall and is weightless. Shadows cannot speak intelligibly. Despite their strange nature and appearance, shadows are not **undead**monsters, and thus cannot be Turned by a Cleric.

A shadow's attack does 1d4 damage (from cold) and drains 1 point of Strength from the victim. Victims reduced to 2 or fewer points of Strength collapse and become unable to move; those reduced to 0 Strength die and rise as shadows a day later (at nightfall). Otherwise, Strength points lost to shadows are recovered at a rate of 1 point per turn.

Due to their incorporeal nature, shadows cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

Giant shrews resemble giant rats, but are larger, being
up to 6' long, and darker in color. They have a very
fast metabolic rate and must eat almost constantly.
Giant shrews are omnivorous, and aggressively defend
their nests and the immediate territory around them.

Giant shrews move so swiftly that they are able to bite
twice per round, and they may attack two different
adjacent opponents in this way.

A few giant shrew species (generally no more than 5%
of those encountered) are venomous. The bite of such
a giant shrew will kill the victim unless a save vs. Poison
is made. A victim bitten twice in a round need only
save once for that round, but of course will have to
save again in subsequent rounds if bitten again.

A shrieker, sometimes called a wailing morel, is a large
(3' to 5' tall and about the same size across), semi-
mobile fungus that wails loudly as a defense mechanism
when approached or threatened. Shriekers are found
in underground areas such as caverns and dungeons.
They are found in a variety of pale colors, most
commonly white, gray, lavender, or red.

This monster does not attack directly; rather, its
shrieking tends to attract the attention of other monsters
in the nearby area. Movement or light within 10 feet,
or causing any damage to one, will cause one to wail
for 1d4 rounds.

In game terms, the GM should generally roll a
wandering monster check each round that this monster
wails.

Skeletons are mindless **undead** created by an evil Magic-User or Cleric, generally to guard a tomb or treasure hoard, or to act as guards for their creator. They take only ½ damage from edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). As with all undead, they can be **Turned** by a Cleric, and are immune to **sleep, charm** or **hold** magic. As they are mindless, no form of mind reading is of any use against them.

Pit vipers are highly venomous snakes. There are many varieties ranging in size from 2' to 12' at adulthood; the statistics above are for an "average" variety which reaches about 9' in length.

Those bitten by a pit viper must save vs. Poison or die.

Pit vipers are named for the thermally sensitive "pits" between their eyes and nostrils. These are used to detect birds, mammals, and lizards, the natural prey of these snakes. Note that, even though lizards are cold-blooded, pit vipers can still sense them because their temperature will often be slightly higher or lower than their surroundings.

Rattlesnakes are a variety of pit viper; in addition to the details given above, a rattlesnake has a rattle (from which it gets its name) at the end of its tail. The rattle is used to warn away larger creatures.

After a successful bite attack, a python will wrap itself around the victim (in the same round), constricting for 2d4 damage plus an additional 2d4 per round thereafter. The hold may be broken on a roll of 1 on 1d6 (add the victim's Strength bonus to the range, so a Strength of 16 would result in a range of 1-3 on 1d6); breaking the hold takes a full round.

Sea snakes are relatively small; the largest varieties rarely exceed 6' in length. They have relatively small heads, and are very stealthy in the water. Their bite does so little damage that the creature bitten has only a 50% chance to notice the attack, but their poison is terribly strong, such that any creature bitten must save vs. Poison at a penalty of -4 or die.

Fortunately, sea snakes rarely attack; only if molested (grabbed, stepped on, etc.) will they do so. They are very clumsy when out of the water.

Spitting cobras average about 7' in length at adulthood. They use their spreading hood to warn other creatures not to bother them, and generally refrain from attacking if possible to allow larger creatures time to retreat. Failure to retreat from the spitting cobra will likely result in the cobra spitting venom; the cobra can project its venom up to 5', and any creature hit must roll a save vs. Poison or be blinded permanently (though the **cure blindness** spell can be used to heal this injury). If the cobra cannot deter a creature by spitting, it will attack using its bite. In this case, those successfully hit must save vs. Poison or die.

Spectres are incorporeal undead monsters. On any
successful hit against a living creature, a spectre drains
two life energy levels in addition to doing normal
damage. Any character slain by a spectre will arise at
the next sunset (but not sooner than 6 hours after
death) as a spectre under the control of its killer.

A spectre will normally resemble the living creature it
used to be. Most spectres are formed from humanoid
creatures, but some may have other forms and sizes;
statistically, most such creatures will be as given above,
but of course the GM may create special types.

Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to **sleep**, **charm** and **hold** magics. Due to their incorporeal nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

The giant black widow spider is a much enlarged version of the ordinary black widow; a full-grown male has a leg-span of 2 feet, while an adult female will be 3' or more across. Despite the size difference, both genders are statistically equal. Both genders are marked with an orange "hourglass" on the abdomen.

The venom of the giant black widow is strong, such that those bitten must save vs. Poison at a penalty of -2 or die. Giant black widow spiders spin strong, sticky, nearly invisible webs, usually across passageways or cave entrances, or sometimes between trees in the wilderness; those who stumble into these webs become stuck, and must roll to escape just as if opening a door. Any character stuck in such a web cannot effectively cast spells or use a weapon.

Crab spiders are ambush predators, hiding using various forms of camouflage and leaping out to bite their surprised prey. Giant crab spiders are horribly enlarged, being around 3' in length. They can change color slowly (over the course of a few days), taking on the overall coloration of their preferred lair or ambush location. After this change is complete, the spider is able to surprise potential prey on 1-4 on 1d6 when in that preferred location. Anyone bitten by a giant crab spider must save vs. Poison or die.

Giant tarantulas are huge, hairy spiders, about the size of a pony. They run down their prey much as wolves do. The bite of the giant tarantula is poisonous; those bitten must save vs. Poison or be forced to dance wildly. The dance lasts 2d10 rounds, during which time the victim has a -4 penalty on attack and saving throw rolls. If the victim is a Thief, he or she cannot use any Thief abilities while dancing. Onlookers must save vs. Spells or begin dancing themselves; such "secondary" victims suffer the same penalties as above, but they will only dance for 2d4 rounds.

Each round the original victim dances, he or she must save vs. Poison again or take 1d4 points of damage. Secondary victims do not suffer this effect.

**Neutralize poison** will cure the original victim, and **dispel magic** will stop the dance for all victims in the area of effect, whether they are original or secondary.

Sprites are reclusive fey creatures, looking like tiny elves just a foot tall with dragonfly-like wings. They go out of their way to fight evil and ugliness and to protect their homelands. Sprites fight their opponents with spell-like abilities and pint-sized weaponry. They prefer ambushes and other trickery over direct confrontation.

Five sprites acting together can cast **remove curse**, or its reversed form **bestow curse**, once per day. The latter spell is often used as an attack.

The giant squid dwells in the deep ocean. One can
grow to a tremendous size, to a maximum of around 40
feet for females and 33 feet for males. The mantle of
the giant squid is about 6½ feet long (more for females,
less for males). Their tentacles are studded with barbs
and sharp-edged suckers.

Members of any group of these creatures encountered
are equally likely to be male or female. The GM may
roll for this or may assign them as they see fit.

In order to bite a creature, the giant squid must hit with
at least two tentacles first. Further, any time a giant
squid hits with at least one tentacle per each 75 pounds
of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it; unless the victim
can find a way to resist (using whatever method the
player might think of and whatever rolls the GM may
choose), they will be pulled into the water and thus be
in danger of drowning. Don't forget to account for the
weight of armor worn!

If a giant squid fails a morale check, it will squirt out a
cloud of black "ink" 30' in diameter and then jet away at
twice normal speed for 3d8 rounds. If a group fails a
morale check they will move away in random directions
in hopes that at least one will escape any pursuit.

Stirges are weird winged creatures that some say may
have invaded from some other plane of existence.
They are relatively small, just about 1 foot long with a
wingspan of about 2 feet and an average weight of 1
pound. They vaguely resemble hairless bats with a
rubbery tubular proboscis and no back legs (so that
their body simply comes to a blunt point at the rear).

If a stirge hits a living creature, it grabs on with hooked
claws on its wing joints and quickly embeds its
proboscis in the victim's body. The proboscis has rows
of tiny serrated teeth on the inside, and literally turns
itself inside out as it carves a way into the victim's body.
This causes 1d4 points of damage, and the stirge then
proceeds to suck the victim's blood, inflicting an
additional 1d4 points of damage each round.

Once attached, the creature can only be removed by
killing it. The victim cannot use weapons larger than a
dagger or hand axe to attack the creature, and cannot
attack it at all if attacked from behind. Others may
attack the creature with a bonus of +2 on the die roll,
but any attack that misses hits the victim instead.

A strangle vine (sometimes called an assassin vine) is a
strange animated plant found in temperate and tropical
forests, particularly in areas with poor-quality soil. They
fertilize their soil by entangling, constricting, and killing
living creatures, then depositing the bodies in loose soil
around the plant's base.

Because it can lie very still indeed, a strangle vine
surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit
inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes
entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage
thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a
saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added;
this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this
and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to
crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the
victim manages to escape.

Strangle vines are actually mobile, able to uproot
themselves and move slowly from place to place; one
generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds.
They have no visual organs but can sense foes within
30 feet by sound and vibration.

Each plant consists of a single long vine of up to 20 feet
in length, with many smaller vines 5 feet or so in length
packed closely, two vines per foot or thereabouts. The
smaller vines are covered in leaves, and in the fall they
bear clusters of reddish-purple berries which are tough
and bitter but not poisonous.

There is a similar plant found in underground
environments which has leaves the color of iron with
pale shiny metallic veins. They grow near geothermal
vents or springs, and the rotting flesh that surrounds
them often supports mushrooms of various sizes and
types. This fungal growth conceals the strangle vine,
allowing it to surprise on 1-5 on 1d6 as does the above-
ground variety of the plant.

Tentacle worms appear to be giant worms of some sort, averaging 6 to 8 feet long. Their heads are pasty white or grey, but their bodies vary from livid pink or purple to deep green in color. Their tentacles splay out from around the creature's "neck." Some sages believe they are the larval form of some other monster, but this has never been proven.

A tentacle worm can attack as many as three adjacent opponents. Those hit must save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed 2d4 turns. No matter how many of a tentacle worm's attacks hit an opponent in a given round, only one saving throw is required in each such round.

If all opponents of a tentacle worm are rendered paralyzed, it will begin to feed upon the paralyzed victims, doing 1 point of damage every 1d8 rounds until the victim is dead; if other paralyzed victims are still alive, the worm is 50% likely to move on immediately to another still-living victim. Otherwise, it continues to eat the corpse of the slain victim for 1d4 turns.

The tiger is among the largest great cat species, with
male specimens averaging 10 feet in length (including
about 2½ feet of tail) and weighing over 400 pounds.
Females are smaller, averaging about 8 feet long and an
average of about 275 pounds. Tigers are most
recognizable for their dark vertical stripes on orange fur
with a white underside.

Tigers are apex predators and prefer prey such as deer
and wild boar. They are territorial and generally
solitary but social predators, requiring large contiguous
areas of habitat to support their requirements for prey.

A titanothere is a huge prehistoric animal that resembles the rhinoceros; adults average 10' tall and 13' long. They have large, forked horns rather than the pointed horns of rhinos. Like rhinos, they are herd animals, and males aggressively defend the herd; females only enter combat if the male(s) are defeated or the attackers are very numerous. If a single titanothere is encountered, it will be a rogue male; they are bad tempered and prone to attacking smaller creatures that enter their territory.

Treants are a race of large, roughly humanoid tree-
people. When one stands still with its legs together it
cannot be easily distinguished from a normal oak tree.
Their leaves are nearly identical to oak leaves, and are
green in spring and summer, turning orange, red, or
yellow in the fall and winter. A treant's leaves do not
normally fall out in the winter, but as some oaks also
retain their leaves into cold weather this may not help in
identifying one.

Being actual trees, treants are big, averaging 25 to 35
feet in height and weighing 4,000 to 5,000 pounds.
Their language is difficult for most other races to learn,
though Elves are known to have an advantage in
mastering it. Many treants know Elvish, and some who
live near humans learn Common as well.

Treants are slow to act when potential enemies are
nearby, preferring watch them carefully before taking
any action. Because of their excellent camouflage
treants gain surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.

All treants have the power to animate other normal
trees in their area; up to two trees can be animated at
once, but the treant can release one and animate
another if needed. Trees to be animated must be
within 180 feet of the treant, and must remain within
that range or they will return to their normal state. An
animated tree requires a full round to uproot itself
before it can move around, and then can move at a
rate of just 10' per round. Of course, if enemies are
within reach the animated tree need not be uprooted.
If the treant controlling an animated tree is slain or
incapacitated, the tree returns to its normal state.

Any character or creature nearby when this happens
must save vs. Death Ray to scamper away; those who
fail will suffer 2d6 points of damage and will be trapped
under the fallen tree. The GM should consider
battlefield conditions when deciding on the exact results
of such an event.

Trolls are huge, rangy humanoids with lumpy skin that
is a dull grayish green in color. They stand up to 9 feet
tall despite having a rather hunched posture, and may
weigh as much as 600 pounds. Their skin is rubbery
and slightly damp to the touch, and they have long
sharp black claws and long sharp white teeth. Trolls
have a disconcerting tendency to smile toothily most of
the time, as if their brutal lives are the most entertaining
thing imaginable.

Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit
point of damage each round after being injured. A troll
reduced to 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled
for 2d6 rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point.
Note that the troll may "play dead" until it has
regenerated further. Damage from fire and acid cannot
be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a troll
can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower
morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll
faces attackers armed with fire or acid.

The regenerative power of trolls is so great that limbs or
other body parts (even a head!) can be reattached if
severed simply by pressing the severed ends back
together for a moment. Trolls in a group will generally
help dismembered fellows to reassemble themselves,
but only if it's convenient. If the severed part is not
restored, a new one will grow in its place in 1d4 turns.

Note that a troll with a new head will not remember its
former life, nor will it yet know how to speak; it will
behave as would any confused and hostile animal.

Trolls speak a primitive language, and are often fluent
in Goblin, Hobgoblin, Orc, Ogre, or Giant depending
on which of these species live nearest them. A few
(20% or so) speak Common.

Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and
bloodshed. Though trolls could easily use a variety of
weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being
rent by their teeth and claws.

A trollwife is a female troll; despite the name, there is
no requirement that she be married (nor, in fact, do
trolls normally engage in formal marriages). A typical
adult trollwife stands 11 feet tall and weighs 700
pounds. They have no outward appearance of
femininity, at least according to the standards of
humans, elves, or even orcs; rather, a trollwife simply
looks like an extraordinarily large troll. Like a normal
male troll, a trollwife has lumpy skin that is a dull
grayish green in color.

Trollwives have all the abilities and weaknesses of the
males of the species; in particular, they regenerate
exactly as do the males.

When encountered, a trollwife may be alone,
cohabitating with a male (her "husband"), or raising a
brood of trollkin. Roll 1d10; on a result of 1, she is
living alone; on a roll of 2-3, she is raising her young;
on 4 or higher, she is living with a male. If one has a
mate or offspring, there is a 1-3 on 1d10 chance she is
encountered alone, 4-7 that her mate or young are
encountered in her absence, or 8-10 that all are
present.

Add 1 to the trollwife's morale score if she is with her
mate, or 2 if she has young present. This means that,
unless threatened with fire or acid, a trollwife will fight
without checking morale while her offspring are
present. If a trollwife's mate or offspring are slain in her
absence, she will track the killers unerringly, and upon
finding them will attack with the same morale bonus.

Trollwives are solitary with respect to other adult
trollwives, for they hate each other with a fierce
passion. If forced together they will put aside their
enmity until all non-troll enemies are dead (at which
point they may well fight over who will eat the choicest
of the remains).

Trollkin are young trolls. They have all the powers and
weaknesses of trolls, and look exactly like smaller than
normal adult trolls. Even an infant has the same ability
to regenerate as an adult troll.

When you encounter trollkin, you can rest assured that
there is a trollwife nearby (unless, of course, you've
already slain her). They are as bloodthirsty as their
parents; as such, determining the number appearing is
done in a particularly unusual fashion:

Roll 1d6 for the number of individuals, and 2d6 for the
number of hit dice. Divide the number of hit dice by
the number of individuals to arrive at the hit dice of
each individual. Note that a trollkin won't be
encountered having more than 6 hit dice, so if only one
individual is indicated by the 1d6 roll but the 2d6 roll
totals more than 6, you must increase the number of
individuals. The referee should feel free to round the
number of hit dice up or down as they see fit, or to
allocate them in an approximately equal fashion if
desired. Trollkin broods are rolled in this way owing to
the fact that bigger or tougher individuals are likely to
kill and eat the weaker ones, generally when their
mother is out hunting.

Refer to the entry for trolls for details regarding
regeneration, morale checks, and so on; except as
noted above, trollkins share all these features with the
adults

Turtles and tortoises are reptiles with a hard shell into
which the animal can pull its head and legs if
threatened. Turtles will be found in marshes and near
rivers or ponds, while tortoises are terrestrial and
typically found in arid regions. (The specific names
given to these animals are often misleading, as a
tortoise might be called a turtle and vice versa.) The
statistics given above are representative, and can be
used for other species as needed. These animals are
well-camouflaged, gaining surprise on a roll of 1-3 on
1d6 in their natural habitat.

Unicorns are horselike creatures having a single spirally-twisted horn in the middle of the forehead. A typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. A unicorn has deep sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.

Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.

Three times per day a unicorn can cast **cure light wounds** by a touch of its horn. Once per day a unicorn can transport itself 360' (as the spell **dimension door**), and can carry a full load (possibly including a rider) while doing so. A light load for a unicorn is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.

An Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid stronger parties.

Alicorns cannot heal or transport themselves by magic as unicorns do. However, alicorns may become invisible at will, exactly as if wearing a **ring of invisibility**.

These creatures appear to be normal **hobgoblins**, but urgoblins are actually a mutant subspecies. Urgoblins are able to regenerate much as do **trolls** (with the same limitations). All urgoblins are male; if an urgoblin mates with a female hobgoblin, any offspring will also be male, but only one in four such offspring will share their father's gifts. Like hobgoblins, urgoblins wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields into battle, blending in perfectly.

Some hobgoblin tribes consider urgoblins an abomination, and kill them whenever they can be identified. Other hobgoblin tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord them great honor. There are even rumors of a tribe entirely made up of urgoblins, with kidnapped hobgoblin females as their mates; reportedly they slit the throats of all infants born to their mates, so that only those who have the power of regeneration survive.

Vampires are **undead** monsters. Though they may
look just a bit more pale than when they were alive,
they do appear to live and even breathe as mortals do.
A vampire has all the memories and abilities it had in
life, and is effectively immortal. Living forever in the
shadows often leads to vampires being decadent, while
their hunger for blood makes them cruel.

Vampires cast no reflections in silvered mirrors or
water, though despite conventional wisdom to the
contrary they do reflect in shiny base metals; the innate
purity of silver and water simply will not reflect them.
A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a
save vs. Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2
due to the power of the charm. This charm is so
powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by
the vampire.

The bite inflicts 1d3 points of damage, then each round
thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim.
The vampire regenerates (i.e. is healed) for up to 1d6
hit points for each energy level drained. If the victim
dies from the energy drain, they will arise as a vampire
at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later) and
thereafter will be under the complete control of the
"parent" vampire (but is freed if that vampire is ever
destroyed).

If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of
-5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must
assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in
combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a
bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons,
and thus a vampire will generally choose to use a melee
weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than
attempting to bite.

Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and
like all undead are immune to **sleep, charm, and hold**
spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire
is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The
vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later,
recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal
activity as soon as the first point is restored.

Creatures of the night obey vampires. Once per day a
vampire can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10
bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming
any such creatures are nearby). The creatures
summoned arrive 2d6 rounds later and will obey the
vampire for up to an hour before leaving.

Vampires can also transform into the form of these
creatures, assuming the shape of a giant bat (page 66),
giant rat (page 135), or a dire wolf (page 158) at will.
The transformation requires a single round during
which the vampire cannot attack. The flying movement
given above is for the giant bat form; the vampire can
use the attack forms of the animal shape assumed, as
given on the indicated pages. The vampire cannot
activate any of its other powers while in animal form,
but effects already active will remain so.

Vampires are powerful indeed, but they do have
several specific weaknesses.

First, a vampire can be held at bay by several things,
including the smell of garlic, a silver or silvered mirror,
or a holy symbol presented by a believer (GM's
discretion is advised here, but in general someone
threatened by a vampire may be more devout than
usual). In such a situation the vampire cannot
approach within 5 feet of the repellent item or
character, nor can it make any melee attacks or
otherwise touch those within the warded area.

**Running water** (such as a stream or river) acts as a
barrier to a vampire; one cannot cross over any such
waterway, neither by bridge or by waterway or even by
flying. It is possible for a vampire to be carried across
while lying in its own coffin with the lid closed; the
presence of the water flowing beneath the coffin will
force the vampire to remain dormant.

Finally, a vampire may not enter any private dwelling
without being invited by someone who resides there,
and then only if invited while the resident is actually
inside the structure. Public buildings of any sort do not
present this problem; even inns are fully accessible to a
vampire.

**Destroying a vampire** is not an easy task. When
reduced to zero hit points or less a vampire becomes
incapacitated but is not slain (as previously explained).
**If exposed to direct sunlight**, the vampire will be
utterly destroyed in a single round if it cannot find a
way to escape in that time. **Being immersed in running water** (as defined above) causes 3d8 points of
damage each round, and if reduced to zero or fewer hit
points in this way the vampire is destroyed. If the
vampire is **cremated in a funeral pyre** while in any
dormant state it will be destroyed.

The most dramatic method of defeating a vampire is
actually the least reliable: **driving a wooden stake through its heart**. Doing this will instantly reduce the
vampire to zero hit points, and it will remain "dead" for
so long as the stake is present. Removal of the stake,
however, allows the vampire to begin regenerating as
described above. It is not normally possible to drive a
stake through a vampire's heart while it is actively
resisting, but this can be done after reducing the
monster to zero hit points in the usual way. Of course,
after staking a vampire it is possible to use sunlight,
running water, or a funeral pyre as described above to
complete its destruction.

| Morale: | 10 |

| XP: | 25 - 240 |

Giant water termites vary from 1' to 5' in length. They attack using a noxious spray with a range of 5' which stuns the target for a full turn on a hit; a save vs. Poison is allowed to avoid the effect. A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the remainder of the current round and all of the next one.

However, the primary concern regarding these monsters is the damage they can do to boats and ships. Each creature can do 2d4 points of damage to a ship's hull per round (no roll required) for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus the creature's hit dice total; after this time, the monster is full. They eat noisily.

These creatures are found in fresh and salt water as well as in swamps. The freshwater variety tend to be smaller, 1-2 hit dice, the saltwater variety 3-4 hit dice, and those found in swamps range from 2-3 hit dice.

Giant weasels resemble their more normally sized cousins, having long bodies, short legs, and pointed, toothy snouts. They are predatory animals, hunting those creatures smaller than themselves.

Weasels of all sorts are cunning, crafty hunters, and surprise their prey on 1-3 on 1d6. Once a giant weasel bites a living creature, it hangs on, rending with its teeth each round until the victim or the weasel is dead, or until the weasel fails a morale check (rolled normally) in which case it will let go of its victim and flee.

There are many varieties of normal-sized weasel, including several which are called ferrets; in some territories, the giant weasel is thus called a giant ferret. The only distinction is that those which are tamed are always called ferrets, though not all giant ferrets are tame. Various humanoid races as well as some fairy creatures are known to tame giant ferrets for use as guards or war-animals.

These ferocious creatures are about 30 feet long. Killer whales, also called "orca" (both singular and plural), are strikingly marked in black and white, with prominent white patches that resemble eyes. Their real eyes are much smaller and located away from the fake eye-spots.

Killer whales eat fish, squid, seals, and other whales, but are not above consuming a meal of human or demi-human fare.

Narwhals are aquatic mammals resembling large dolphins with a single (or rarely, double) tusk protruding straight forward from the mouth. The tusk is helical in shape, and they are sometimes cut short and sold as "unicorn horns." However, they have no particular magical value. Narwhals are found in cold northern seas. They are not particularly aggressive.

These creatures can be up to 60 feet long. They prey on giant squid. Sperm whales can emit an invisible focused beam of sound 5' wide up to a 50' range underwater. This blast of sound disorients target creatures, leaving them effectively stunned for 1d4 rounds. A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the indicated duration. No attack roll is required, but a save vs. Death Ray is allowed to resist. A sperm whale can emit as many such blasts of sound as it desires, once per round, instead of biting.

A wight's appearance is a weird and twisted reflection of the form it had in life. A wight is about the height and weight of a human. Wights do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

If a wight touches (or is touched by) a living creature, that living creature suffers one level of **energy drain** (as described in the **Encounter** section). No saving throw is allowed. Striking a wight with a weapon does not count as "touching" it.

Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight by the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later). Wight spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death.

Like all undead, wights may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to **sleep**, **charm** and **hold** magics. Wights are harmed only by silver or magical weapons, and take only half damage from burning oil.

Wolves are pack hunters known for their persistence and cunning. They prefer to surround and flank a foe when they can.

Dire wolves are efficient pack hunters that will kill anything they can catch. Dire wolves are generally mottled gray or black, about 9 feet long and weighing some 800 pounds.

Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness. In some cases, the grim silhouette of a wraith might appear armored or outfitted with weapons. This appearance does not affect the creature's AC or combat abilities but only reflects the shape it had in life.

Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to **sleep**, **charm** and **hold** magics. Due to their incorporeal nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail. A wyvern's body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about one ton. They are built more like bats than lizards, having two legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have four legs and two wings.

Wyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of a bull alligator.

Wyverns attack nearly anything that isn't obviously more powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, clawing at its opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. Any living creature hit by the wyvern's stinger must save vs. Poison or die. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack or when landing.

If a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry off its victim; only victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most 6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it may be dropped.

All within 10 feet of the mold will be affected by the spores and must save vs. Death Ray or take 1d8 points of damage per round for 6 rounds. Sunlight renders yellow mold dormant.

Zombies are the **undead** corpses of humanoid creatures. They are deathly slow, but they move silently, are very strong and must be literally hacked to pieces to "kill" them. They take only half damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). A zombie never has Initiative and always acts last in any given round. Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to **sleep**, **charm** and **hold** magics. As they are mindless, no form of mind reading is of any use against them. Zombies never fail morale checks, and thus always fight until destroyed.

A Zombraire is a free-willed undead Magic-User. Like
the zombie it resembles, a zombraire moves silently, is
very strong, and must be literally hacked to pieces to be
destroyed. However, it does not suffer the initiative
penalty common to ordinary zombies. It takes only half
damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point
from arrows, bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical
bonus). It may be Turned by a Cleric (as a wight), and
is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells.

A zombraire slowly rots away, and as it does it loses its
sanity; this is represented by the variable morale listed.
An insane zombraire fights to the death in hopes of
being slain, thus ending its tortured existence.

The given statistics are for a zombraire formed from a
2nd-level Magic-user; the HD and saving throws of a
zombraire are based on the level it had in life. A
zombraire can cast spells as it did when living, but
cannot learn new spells.

A Skeletaire is the final form of a zombraire which has
rotted away completely. It takes only half damage from
edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows,
bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical bonus). It can
be Turned by a Cleric (as a zombie), and is immune to
sleep, charm, and hold spells. A skeletaire never fails
morale, and thus always fights until destroyed.

The statistics above are for a skeletaire formed from a
2nd-level Magic-user. A skeletaire will have HD equal
to the character's level minus 1, and will save as a
Magic-user of the level equal to its HD. The skeletaire
cannot speak, but still retains the ability to prepare and
cast spells as it did in life (but like a zombraire, it cannot
learn new spells).

The process of creating or becoming a zombraire are
variable, and often involve cursed magic items
(especially cursed scrolls).
